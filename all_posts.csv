Well... we figured out what the smell was. ,20574,1g40tbp,mildlyinfuriating,https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1g40tbp/well_we_figured_out_what_the_smell_was/,464,1728971052.0,"I thought I was going crazy for a while. I would be relaxing on my couch, or putzing around doing chores and I would get the weirdest smell. It smelled almost meaty and sharp. At first I thought my dog had hidden a chew or bully stick somewhere. I tore my house apart! Cleaning walls and floors and furniture and baseboards; anything I could get to on the first floor. And I was smell-checking EVERYTHING. I moved onto cleaning out the fridge and moving all appliances to check behind. Nothing. We also have cats, I wondered if they were maybe peeing somewhere, but cat pee is so distinct and this was not cat pee. One day, I smelled it on the second floor on the back end of the house, it's fucking following me. Cue deep cleaning on the second floor. 

We worked so hard to buy our house this spring and I felt dread thinking something was in the walls and I couldn't get to it, or there was a bigger hidden issue. But what could cause an occasional smell? There was no pattern, just ~sometimes~. And then... it was gone.

So. There has been construction on the road in front of our house since mid-August. About a week ago, the construction crew moved to a parallel street to continue the project. Around the same time I stopped smelling the rotted meat smell. Do you want to know what moved with them? Their giant red stupid fucking porta potty. There's nothing wrong with my house. I was just upwind of 7 to 8 mens worth of piss and shit for two months. "

I felt I was assigned the inability to be consistent at birth due to my ADHD. This led to me always feeling scared of losing habits, worried I couldn't maintain a journal or practice a craft enough to become proficient in anything. 

When my mom passed away, that all came to a head and I couldn't maintain my house of cards anymore, even mundane tasks became arduous and the idea of returning to my writing felt absolutely alien. So I took out a box of embroidery supplies I bought myself and hid, legitimately insecure of being noticed having an interest in an art, and I started stitching. 

I have not looked back. I also have such unbelievable biceps, I did not expect tying knots to buff away my trauma üí™"

AITA for refusing to let my sister wear white to my wedding and kicking her out when she showed up in it?,8409,1g40g66,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g40g66/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_sister_wear_white_to/,1295,1728969549.0,"I (27F) got married two weeks ago, and it was supposed to be the happiest day of my life. My sister (31F), who I have a complicated relationship with, decided to test me in the worst way possible. We‚Äôve never been close, she‚Äôs always tried to one-up me, even during family events. It‚Äôs exhausting, but I figured she‚Äôd at least behave at my wedding.

Months ago, when I sent out the dress code, I made it very clear: no one wears white but me. It wasn‚Äôt negotiable. My sister gave me attitude about it, saying I was being ‚Äúinsecure‚Äù and that ‚Äúno one cares about tradition anymore.‚Äù I told her that whether or not she agreed, she needed to respect it.

The morning of the wedding, she showed up wearing a floor-length, lace white dress. It was practically a bridal gown. My heart dropped, and I straight-up asked her what the hell she was thinking. She said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that white, and besides, no one will care.‚Äù

I told her that if she didn‚Äôt change, she wasn‚Äôt welcome. She threw a tantrum about how I was ruining her day and stormed off, telling everyone I was being ‚Äúbridezilla.‚Äù Some family members told me to let it slide because ‚Äúshe‚Äôs just like that,‚Äù but I was done.

So, I told the staff not to let her back in unless she changed. She never came back, and now she‚Äôs telling everyone I ruined the relationship for good. My parents are mad, saying I should‚Äôve just ignored her because ‚Äúit‚Äôs only a dress,‚Äù but I feel like this was a deliberate choice to sabotage my day. My husband agrees with me, but some family is still pissed.

So AITA?"

His last job was really judgemental, with ""real working men"" who only really complained about their wives/girlfriends. I once made lunch for him to take with and put a note in it with ""goodluck at work honey! Love you ‚ù§Ô∏è"" and they made fun of him for quite a bit. It broke my heart to hear that and he quit soon after. 

We said our goodbyes when his break ended, I gave him a big kiss and not even a couple minutes after I got a message from him ""My coworkers are cooing over how sweet we were just now, they already love you."" 
It really warms my heart to know he has nice colleagues and has so much fun there! 
Don't really have anyone to tell this to, so enjoy this little bit of positivity I experienced today :D"

I parked nose in, next to a large pole on my left. There was an empty car space beside me when I went into the centre. 

When I returned to my car with a full shopping trolley, a man had parked next to me, reverse in. He was on his phone, standing in between my car and his, with his drivers door open. The door almost touching my drivers door. 

I have him a nod, to say hello, unloaded groceries into my boot and returned my trolley. 

When I came back to my car, I said ""Excuse me please."" so I could enter my car, thinking he'd realise I wanted to leave. 

He gave me the biggest sideways stinkeye, still talking on his phone, but did move slightly and close his door so I could get in my car. 

As soon as I'm in, he opens his door again. Now, if I had reversed, my wing mirror would have clipped his door. And I can't swing my car the other way because of the pole. 

I lower my window, ask nicely, ""Excuse me, can close your door? So I can leave?""

He glares at me, holds up a finger in a 'Wait!' gesture, and turns away. 

Ok. I close my window, lock the doors, look at him directly, and lay my hand on the horn. 

He spins around and oh, if looks could kill. He's still on the phone. My hand is still on the horn. 

He glares at me even harder. My hand is still on the horn. I raise my eyebrows and keep looking directly at him. 

He gets in his car and slams his door. I take my hand off the horn. ""Thank you."" I mouth at him with a sweet smile, and reverse my car. 

Was i petty? Yes. Did it feel good? Also yes. "

The only one I could afford was a tiny studio with the quirk that the room had its own bathroom, but it was out in the hall. The landlord made it clear that it was my bathroom and being a 20 something guy I didn't really care. I didn't really care, that is, until my toilet paper started disappearing. I would sit down to use the bathroom and then to my shock the whole roll would be gone. It wasn't hard to figure out that one of my neighbors was going into the bathroom (which could only be locked from the inside) and stealing my toilet paper. 

After this happening a few times, I had an idea. I took a roll of toilet paper and unrolled a few feet of it on my apartment floor. I had bought a jar of sliced jalape√±os and put the liquid in a spray bottle and sprayed the toilet paper and let it dry overnight before rolling it back up. It looked totally like a normal roll of toilet paper when I placed it. For the next few days I brought my own toilet paper to the bathroom and eagerly watched for when the thief had taken the roll sprayed with the jalape√±o juice. After about a week, the roll disappeared and I admit the devilish joy still makes me happy to remember. And yes, I never had a problem with having my toilet paper stolen again. "

Every year I go through the pantry and donate anything I won‚Äôt use, bought too many of, things my daughter liked until I bought it in bulk, etc. (I make sure nothing is expired). This year in addition to the typical items, I have several bottles of bbq sauce and wing sauces from a charity raffle basket I won, salad dressings, and multiple big bottles of flavored coffee syrups. I had planned to donate these as well until another school mom made a comment that it was tacky and out of touch, since those are ‚Äúluxuries‚Äù and won‚Äôt help people who need actual food.

At one time when I was much younger, I was in a very bad place in life and frequently relied on food banks to survive. I‚Äôm very fortunate now to be in a much better place in life and in a position to be able to help other people. It was such a dark time for me and made me feel so ashamed and low. If I had gotten something like a bottle of sauce to add to meals or a coffee syrup to make a fancy coffee drink, that would have been such a special treat and added a little bright spot in such an awful situation. Just having something more than bare necessities would have felt incredible. However the comments from the other mom have made me second guess myself. In no way would I want to come across as insulting or tone deaf. What are your thoughts?
 
Edit: Thank you so much for so many responses! This was my first Reddit post ever and I did not expect so many comments. I was clearly just overthinking things, of course I should know better than her, she comes across as someone who has never been in that situation. I know how much it would have meant to me to get something more special than basics, and I hope my extras do the same for someone else üôÇ And just to clarify, the ‚Äúregular‚Äù foods I‚Äôm donating are not unappealing items that no one would want, they‚Äôre things like canned Spaghetti-Os and ravioli, canned soups, mixed fruit, muffin and cookie mixes, all things that  a lot of people would use, but we aren‚Äôt going to use."

Gen Z misuses therapy speak too much,2093,1g40hch,GenZ,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1g40hch/gen_z_misuses_therapy_speak_too_much/,539,1728969670.0,"I‚Äôve noticed Gen Z misuses therapy speak way too much. Words like gaslight, narcissist, codependency, bipolar disorder, even ‚Äúboundaries‚Äù and ‚Äútrauma‚Äù are used in a way that‚Äôs so far from their actual psychiatric/psychological definitions that it‚Äôs laughable and I genuinely can‚Äôt take a conversation seriously anymore if someone just casually drops these in like it‚Äôs nothing. 

There‚Äôs some genuine adverse effects to therapy speak like diluting the significance of words and causing miscommunication. Psychologists have even theorized that people who frequently use colloquial therapy speak are pushing responsibility off themselves -  (mis)using clinical terms to justify negative behavior (ex: ghosting a friend and saying ‚Äúsorry it‚Äôs due to my attachment style‚Äù rather than trying to change.) 

I understand other generations do this too, but I think Gen Z really turns the dial up to 11 with it. 

So stop it!! Please!! For the love of god. A lot of y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know what these words mean! 

Here are some articles discussing the rise of therapy speak within GEN Z and MILENNIAL circles:

Some people said you lost the xp. 
Some people said you got the xp and it was just a visual glitch. 
Some people said you ONLY get the xp if you use a lucky egg. 

I have two very young kids who have accounts and don‚Äôt care about xp so I thought I‚Äôd try it out and help people get a definitive answer. 

I ranked up to best friends and then deleted them. One I used a lucky egg for and one I didn‚Äôt. I took pictures of their xp before and after this. And I can say with 100% certainty you get the xp REGARDLESS. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you use the egg or not. Both accounts got the xp. Both accounts came up with the pop up but said ‚Äú0xp doubled with egg‚Äù. 

TL:DR, you get the xp regardless.

EDIT: I posted a video on my profile of a third one I did just now showing the whole process. Much love guys! Now if anyone can work out how to get the Galarian birds to show up on my daily walks, let me know haha.

His story is really unique (and long) but i promise it worth reading all the eay through. His mother was abandoned in my neighborhood. She was really friendly and would let me pet her when I saw her, and late night she started meowing outside my door, because she was starving. I woke up and gave her a little bit of food, all I had was some lunch meat. She kept coming around after that and became the community cat, until one day a rottweiler got off the leash. He almost had her, but then I decided to take my trash out and just happened to open the door just as she was running by. She turned on a dime and ran in my apartment while the dog was right behind her. I slammed the door and locked it, and the dog hit the door full force and almost knocked it off the hinges. She stuck around until it was safe and then went back outside again, but a few weeks later I went to take the trash out again and left the door cracked, and when I went back inside she was sitting in my living room. I let her hang around, and not long after Sheldon was born in my apartment 10 days after my 26th birthday, along with two brothers and a sister.

I had no idea what I was doing, but I managed to get all the kittens and the mom to good homes. The entire time I was trying to find homes for them, Sheldon would follow me everywhere. He couldn't even walk yet, but he managed to crawl behind me whenever I got up. After I had gotten the other kittens to their new homes, I realized the area was too dangerous for his mom to stay there, but no one ever asked about taking Sheldon in. I realize now that it was because he chose me, so I kept him and he was the best thing that ever happened to me.

He was so smart that it was scary, and he had a huge personality to match. He always made me laugh, always was ready to play, and loved to just curl up with me and hangout, he loved sitting next to me while laying against my hip. The thing is that when all of this happened, I wasn't doing well. I was broke and working a shit job for no money, and was still trying to deal with a really abusive upbringing. To be honest, I was really considering checking out. Multiple times during his life, I badly wanted to kill myself, but knowing that Sheldon wouldn't have anywhere to go kept me from doing it. He saved my life so many times and that's why I'm posting this, because everyone should know how much he helped me. In 2020 especially, I was ready to go. Covid had hit and after years of struggling financially, I had finally gotten a decent paying job with a really great team, only to get layed off that summer. I had decided that this time I was truly done, I pulled up a spreadsheet and started listing who would get my possessions, and then I'd send everything to a lawyer and kill myself when it was setup. But then Sheldon walked in the room, and again I realized I didn't have anyone that could take care of him. I'd never let him end up on the street and refused to let him wind up in a shelter somewhere, he would've been miserable. 

So this time I made him a deal, I'd stick around, but only until he was gone, then I'd join him shortly after. But as luck would have it, my career suddenly took off. All the sudden I went from making ok money to making six figures. I didn't really know what to do, so I just saved for a year, then started going to therapy consistently since I could finally afford it. And late last year, I finally landed a great job that wasn't just contract. I would make more money and could continue to work from home, and was finally brought on full time early this year. I finally felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders and could enjoy life.

Around this time, Sheldon was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. I knew something was up, he was old and was really thirsty all the time. My friend had been bulletproof his entire life, and then suddenly he wasn't. I was able to get him on the right dose of medication, and he was great again. But then in April he hurt his foot, he had gotten a nail stuck in the carpet during one of his many sprints around the house. Even in old age, he still acted like a kitten. The injury had gotten infected also, so I took him to the vet again and got him fixed up.

Around this time I noticed he was sleeping more, 'oh well, he's 12 years old, he had to slow down a bit sometime' I thought. But in june I took him to the vet for his 6 month checkup and I knew something was up. He fought like a brave when I tried to get him in his carrier, he never liked going to the vet, but he never fought like this. This cat never made a sound a single time during any vet visits, but when they blgsve him back to me after having blood drawn, he mowed at me when I looked at him in his carrier, and I knew right then thay he was sick. A few days later the vet confirmed it, and a specialist diagnosed him with multiple myeloma. I had been warned by the vet that the thyroid issue was usually masking something, but he seemed fine. His levels early this year had been a bit off, but I was told it wasn't anything major. Now his proteins were very elevated and white blood cell count was low. I think he hid the illness and that's why he wouldn't go to the vet, he knew if he got in the carrier he'd be found out.

I did the best I could for him and spent as much as possible with him until he told me he wasn't feeling good anymore. He went from being happy and talkative to sullen and quiet. I decided to put together a go bag in case I had to bring him to the ER in the middle of the night, but I when I was making sure I hadn't forgotten anything, I realized this meant it was time. I was able to say goodbye to him at home just the way he deserved. I didn't want him to go out feeling so bad that he would mess himself and couldn't clean himself up, or be in so much pain that he couldn't move. His last day was August 31st, the day before my birthday. That morning, I told him that it was ok and that someone was coming that afternoon to help him move on. I went back to bed after that just trying to deal with everything, and suddenly he jumped on the bed and got under the covers with me and cuddled and purred for the first time in weeks. That afternoon it was supposed to rain, but I like to think the sun stayed out just for him. I fed him treats and held him while we sat in the sun together while the vet put him to sleep. I thanked him for choosing me, for saving me, and for all the love he gave me over the years. The last thing he heard was the same thing I'd said to him when we curled up together many times before 'best friends'. Afterward, the vet placed lillies around him and I carried him to her car and said goodbye to him, then sat on the steps and watched then drive away.

He saved my life, many times and I miss him dearly. I've cried everyday since I lost him, but he's still helping me even now. Shortly after his death, I started seeing sparks randomly. Then the lamp would flicker, then one day the overhead light randomly turned on while I was on the couch. Not long after all this, I found an old phone that had his baby pictures on it. I was in a really bad place and was just thinking that he should've gotten one more year, and when I uploaded his baby pictures, I realized that he did. I had screwed up his age at some point, turns out he was a year older than I remembered, he did get that year. Once I realized this, it was like he helped me again by alleviating most of my guilt. He had been gone for 3 weeks at that point and had still found a way to help me. 

Then a few days ago something else happened. A friend had convinced me to go to operation kindness just to look around, and to be honest, i went with no intention of taking anyone home. I had decided to wait until maybe next year to seriously consider looking, and that the only way I'd have another cat is if they were grey like him, and whatever I'd name them, it was always start with an 'S' as a way to keep his memory alive. 

I met some really sweet cats, but nobody that really made me feel anything, I figured it was a bust. But multiple people asked me if I got to meet Sonic, so I decided I'd meet one more and then go home. The lady came and got him, a little grey and white kitten, and sat him on the bench I was sitting on. Immediately he looked at me, then came and layed against my hip just like Sheldon used to, juat like in that second picture. I put my hand under him and he just started purring right away, then he bit my finger just like Sheldon did his entire life, and I knew. I started crying and once I calmed down, I knew I had to take him home.

I adopted him then and there, and he's parked on my hip as I type this. The way I see it, Sheldon has now saved three lives, mine, Sonic, and the cat that takes his old spot at operation kindness. I'm still sad that he's gone, but Sonic has really helped give me purpose again. He's so happy to be with me.in his forever home, and I'm happy to have a friend in the house again.

If you read this far, I'm sorry it took so long, but it means the world to me if you stuck around to the end. I'd never be able to get the words out in person, so thus was the only way I could do it. I don't know if anyone will read this, but I wanted to tell everyone about Sheldon and what he means to me, he was my soul cat and I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him.

Everyone should have a friend like Sheldon,I truly believe that he was the best cat that ever lived. Even though this was my best attempt to let the world know about him, nothing I can say will ever do him justice, or truly describe the love I have for him.

I miss you buddy, I hope one day we meet again.

Best friends.

"Jay musste ""ausversehen"" etwas essen, gegen das er allergisch ist. Warum das √§u√üerst problematisch war und kein Grund zum Lachen.",757,1g43me8,PietSmiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/PietSmiet/comments/1g43me8/jay_musste_ausversehen_etwas_essen_gegen_das_er/,92,1728984248.0,"Vorab, die Thematik mit Jay und seiner Glutenintoleranz ist eher ein Nischenthema, weil diese Allergie ziemlich selten ist und Jay es selten zum Thema macht. 

Daher habe ich lange gez√∂gert das Thema √ºberhaupt hier zu bringen, mich dann aber doch daf√ºr entschieden, weil einerseits eine gewisse Aufkl√§rung f√ºr den kleinen Teil an Betroffenen sehr wichtig ist und andererseits eine Unprofessionalit√§t des Orgateams zeigt.

Wer meine Anmerkungen zu dem Vorfall downvoten m√∂chte kann das gerne tun, aber bitte erst nachdem er sie gelesen hat...

Also, was ist passiert? 

Jay hat bei Alle gegen Hamburg im Dschungelcamp-Teil Eier mit So√üe gegessen. Diese So√üe war mit glutenhaltigem Mehl angedickt, welches Jay nicht essen darf. 

Er ging davon aus, dass er es essen d√ºrfte, da ""es besprochen war"" wie er sagte. Entsprechend entsetzt war er, dass sie ihm trotzdem ein glutenhaltiges Gericht essen lie√üen... 

Man hat auch gemerkt dass Jay darauf nicht mit dem √ºblichen Humor reagiert hat sondern das er wirklich schockiert und vermutlich auch entt√§uscht war. Allein der Livesituation auf der B√ºhne ist es vermutlich zu verdanken, dass er den Auftritt fortgesetzt hat.

Das Problem: Wenn jemand mit Glutenintoleranz/Z√∂liakie (es ist mir unbekannt was genau Jay hat) Gluten isst, ist das in der Regel nicht mal eben so ein Missgeschick, was nach einer Sitzung auf dem Klo wieder vergessen ist, wie bei manch anderen Nahrungsallergien.

Die Glutenaufnahme, auch in geringer Menge, zetst√∂rt bei den Betroffenen die Darmschleimhaut und es braucht Wochen oder Monate damit diese sich davon wieder regeneriert. Im schlimmsten Fall, vorallem wenn man immer wieder Gluten zu sich nimmt, k√∂nnen sich b√∂sartige Tumoren entwickeln.

Insofern k√∂nnte die saloppe Bemerkung von Andi, ""Mehl sei ja kein Gift"", nicht falscher sein. Denn glutenhaltiges Mehl IST defacto Gift f√ºr einen Betroffenen.

Die unmittelbaren Folgen sind bei jedem Betroffenen nat√ºrlich anders. Jay berichtete in einer Instastory von Magenkr√§mpfen. Mir sind aber auch F√§lle bekannt, die wegen massivem Durchfall in der Notaufnahme endeten.

Die langfristigen Folgen sind jedoch wegen der erw√§hnten Zerst√∂rung der Schleimhaut schwerwiegender als die kurzfristigen. Das ist der entscheidende Unterschied zu vielen anderen Allergien wie zB der bekannteren Laktoseintoleranz.

Es gibt auch keine Tablette oder √Ñhnliches, die man nimmt und dann ist wieder alles gut. Die einzige Therapie ist kein Gluten zu essen.

Insofern war die Aktion, man muss es so sagen, gesundheitsgef√§hrdend f√ºr Jay und h√§tte nicht passieren d√ºrfen. 

Es ist schon klar dass da keine B√∂swilligkeit seitens des Teams dabei war, aber das Jay trotz vorheriger Besprechung das falsche Essen vorgesetzt bekommt ist einfach unprofessionell und auch fahrl√§ssig!

Mir tat Jay sehr leid, auch da er vermutlich der einzige war, der in dem Moment wusste, welche Konsequenzen der Vorfall hat."

After months of looking, finally a baby caught my attention. I went to the shelter and discovered a scarred antisocial baby. I decided to adopt her. 

She was schedule to be fixed 4 days later. When I took her in, the lady who took her was flabbergasted how good she looked. She made a comment about how she could see. I was confused until she realized her mistake. She thought the pup was the sister of the one I adopted. I was like - she has a sister?

The lady explained her sister was mostly blonde due to ulcers in her eyes. She was the runt and in worse condition than the others brought in. When I picked up my adopted baby, Roxanne‚Ä¶ they brought out her sister for me to see. Instantly Roxanne perked up. Now‚Ä¶ I have 2 babies who live each other dearly. I named her sister Layla. Layla is currently a foster to adopt until she is medically cleared. 

I took her to my vet for her eyes. My vet said while she may never have great vision, she will be able to see some which is better than completely blind as the shelter informed me. She has a lot of scar tissue in one eye and still active ulcer in the other.

She is on 3 meds and vitamins for eye sight. I can finally see the color of her eyes which means things are healing up nicely. So happy with her progress. "

[Update] AITAH for breaking up with and kicking my girlfriend out because she went to an afterparty without me?,2529,1g41o7c,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g41o7c/update_aitah_for_breaking_up_with_and_kicking_my/,268,1728974795.0,"About two weeks ago, I came here for moral guidance after breaking up with and kicking my girlfriend out for going to an afterparty with her male co-worker, who outwardly stated that I was not invited.

Just about everyone in the post was convinced that Anne had cheated on me with Joe. The moment she left, I felt as if I had lost interest in her, Joe, and both of their lives forever. But a couple of days later, morbid curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to find his Instagram through Anne's. I don't know if I was looking for closure or validation for refusing to even discuss the issue with Anne, but I found both.

First, a few hours after Joe drove Anne back to my place, he made an Instagram post about potentially doing a cover for Scotty Doesn't Know by Lustra. The comments were full of people saying he was ""going to hell"" with laughing crying emojis and the shushing emoji. I recognized some of the commenters as people who had attended the party. At first, I didn't know what it was about, but after looking up the lyrics, it became clear. Here's the first line of the song:

>*Scotty doesn't know that Fiona and me do it in my van every Sunday.*

So yeah. Class act, he is. Catchy song, though.

But it gets better. I know this wasn't healthy, but I kind of kept up with Anne and Joe's social media. They went full mask-off. Another few days later, Joe posted a picture of Anne sitting on his lap. I could tell that based on the sofa he was sitting on, this was not even taken at the afterparty, but *at the party that I went to.* I must have been talking to someone else or in the bathroom when it was taken.

I will say that I was severely depressed and, on a certain level, probably still am. It wasn't even really about Anne, but that literally nobody from the party was willing to give me a heads up. Anne and I were publicly dating. We showed up together. People knew I was her boyfriend. But I guess when my back was turned, they were laughing at me. 

The only thing that doesn't make sense to me at this point is why she even wanted to keep me around as a partner. When I kicked her out, she was legitimately upset. Was this a pride issue where she wanted to be the one to dump me? Was it the thrill of screwing around with her co-worker behind my back? Or was this some logic that only the human equivalent of a dumpster could understand? I may never know.

It doesn't matter anymore. 

I want to thank everyone who responded to the last post, and I really want to give a special thanks to those who posted or DM'd me with similar experiences. Without exaggeration, I don't know what I'd be doing right now if it weren't for your comments."

The only way for the riders to deposit cash is through a bank deposit and torn notes aren't accepted through machines and we literally can't go stand in a line and deposit in a bank as we lose work hours 

Many people literally forget they've ordered something and make us wait for more 30 minutes without picking the call for which swiggy penalises the rider if order gets delayed multiple times

Please make sure the address and the location tagged is correct and please use the instruction box properly.
(One instance where someone from one of those swanky apartments opposite madhavan park had ordered something and put in no instructions and ordered from a different number, when i called the number i got yelled at phone from that person's relative and then when i got to the door, i got yelled again for not calling first and all the residents in that floor came in and yelled at me and treated me like some thief saying that delivery people are not allowed inside the apartment. All that person could've done is that put in instructions properly while ordering and there was no board infront of the gate)
So please please learn to use the delivery instruction box properly 

Dogs, as a pet lover i understand that my dog is obviously going to get hostile when someone new is about to enter the house. So please if you have dogs, please come near the gate and collect the order.

And this is not me guilt tripping people to leave tips or anything 
Please understand that the base pay (if the distance is less than 1kms) swiggy pays for instamart rider is 15rs per order and most of the delivery people have to work around 12 to 14 hours a day to make 1k a day. They're paid for the distance they ride, not the number of floors they climb.

This isn't me coming from a product manager perspective or marketing perspective, this is me coming from a humanity perspective.
The hub has around 80 riders for which there will be atleast 10 to 15 people present in the hub at a time and there's no seating area for the riders, or a proper washroom facility and most of the public toilets are closed around 7pm and it costs 3rs to pee in a public toilet.
So the base pay is literally worth pissing a few times.

These companies are built on the blood sweat and tears of the delivery partners. So all i ask is a little bit of humanity from people.

edit: people keep commenting that they hope ""my father"" is ok. I just know him. His actual child is the top comment here. Her dad did not deserve this. I heard he was only outside of his bus because he was trying to check on someone to make sure she was ok before he got sucker punched."

Boyfriend doesn‚Äôt understand that I look the way I do because I diet,899,1g41msa,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1g41msa/boyfriend_doesnt_understand_that_i_look_the_way_i/,295,1728974618.0,"My boyfriend is the most wonderful, caring, and loving man in the world, so please don‚Äôt take any of this to be super negative or angry. It‚Äôs more of a small rant that I keep rehashing in my mind. 

I will admit that I‚Äôve struggled with food in the past, so I have an understanding of what it‚Äôs like to overcome anorexia. For me, being recovered means that I eat enough food to be functional, and I allow myself to go out to eat a couple times a month. I know that‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs definition of having a healthy relationship with food, but it‚Äôs leagues above how I used to be and I‚Äôm proud of how far I‚Äôve come. 

My boyfriend gets really worried when I comment on calories or stress about certain ingredients being in recipes that he makes. I try my absolute best not to, but it‚Äôs so ingrained in my mind after years of being anorexic that it just comes out sometimes without me even thinking about it.

He really wants me to feel comfortable eating anything, and I appreciate the sentiment, but my problem comes from him always telling me how beautiful he thinks I am. He tells me that I‚Äôm the most beautiful girl he‚Äôs ever seen and that he absolutely loves my body. I love the compliments, but whenever he starts worrying about my habits with food, I just want to tell him that he loves the way I look BECAUSE I have such strict food rules. I wouldn‚Äôt look how I do if I ate whatever I wanted or didn‚Äôt count calories. 

Idk, typing all of this out makes me sound crazy, but it‚Äôs a constant thought I‚Äôve been having recently (he‚Äôs started cooking for me more often) that I don‚Äôt know how to share with him. I want to be skinny and be perfectly healthy, but I don‚Äôt know how to do that. "

Cut to me going through the security checkpoint for jury duty and the guards stop my bag in the x-ray. I think it's because I'm sneaking a sandwich and lasagna into jury duty, because I didn't realize the no-food policy. She points at a long, cylindrical thing in my bag that looks like it has batteries in it. Huh! A flashlight I forgot about?

I'm opening up my bag in front of them and then it dawns on me. My vibrating butt plug. Please no, why would I bring THAT to jury duty! I try to skirt around it, there must be SOMETHING else. But no, that's it. I admit to them that it's embarrassing, because it's a sex toy, and they both start politely laughing, it's not the strangest thing they've seen. I doubt that. 

I wasn't ready to share my bedroom secrets with court guards this morning. 

TL;DR: Forgot I had a butt plug in my bag at jury duty security found it."

Thanks for reaching out! We're unaware of the situation with the show but we appreciate the context as to why we've received so many random inquiries about when the color Deep Pond/Dark Khaki was released in different Kuhl jackets. This information helps us provide an informed response.

Deep Pond/Dark Khaki was a seasonal colorway in multiple jackets created for our Fall of 2023 line. The jacket in the photos you provided is the Stretch Voyagr Jacket. The Stretch Voyagr Jacket in Deep Pond/Dark Khaki could've been purchased in August of 2023 or later from our website. It's also possible the jacket could've been purchased from one of our authorized retailers sometime starting in June of 2023. The jacket was not available to the public in 2022.

I'm not very internet savvy and this is my first real reddit post. 

But this is my 640 gallon tilapia tub turned into a tropical fish pond. Located in southern Florida I'm able to keep quite a variety. A little background on the pond. It's about 8ft round and holds 640 gallons of water. Iv added a waterfall box and a small bog over flow. I mostly rely on plants and floss for filtration. Iv got two pumps in boxes that circulate the water at about 1200 gallons per hour per filter. When they aren't clogged with poo lol. I plan on adding an over flow and separate sump to keep the filters in and a much larger bog filter. I also would like to add a brick wall around the pond so that it looks more like a fountain or well as opposed to it's giant Rubbermaid like appearance lol. The intent of this project was actually to keep a giant gourami but in the heat of an emergency I needed a new home for my comet who iv had since he was about an inch. Iv kept my fair share of exotic fish over the years and have found myself having an absolute blast keeping fish in once kept as a kid. After about 8 months my pond is overgrown with aquatic plants and now has over 30 species of fish co-existing. I thought I'd share this new discovery of the versatility of keeping fish in a tub and would love any kind of feed back.

"15 month difference, a win over depression and addiction",8173,1g3zpj5,MadeMeSmile,https://i.redd.it/puyg9ktsluud1.jpeg,298,1728966741.0,"TLDR; overcame a very shitty lifestyle, addiction, trauma, deep depression, got healthy, fit and strong, naturally (no steroids), and I hope I can inspire others to do the same. 

So I suppose you can call this a transformation.. I‚Äôve never done anything like this online so it‚Äôll probably come across clumsy and awkward lol..  I‚Äôd like to preface this by saying this isn‚Äôt a cry for attention, a sob story poor me (despite the sonny aspects), or a humble brag type thing, as I know how douchey this stuff can come across to those who might not be crazy passionate about sports.. I‚Äôm posting this purely as a ‚Äúif I can not only survive that shit, but come out of it stronger and focused on something, then you can. Anyone can‚Äù. I just feel like sharing some of my story so that it might inspire or comfort those in similar situations with similar experiences, 

a year and 3 month,  difference age 31 vs 32.. I went from 62kg/136lbs to 90kg/198lbs relatively lean‚Ä¶ but before all of that, I was in absolute pit of depression, totally hopeless, filled with hate for everyone and everything, I was a hairs breadth away from committing suicide, I very nearly did..  my mental health has never really been spectacular, still isn‚Äôt, but this was a particularly bad time after dealing with a lot of trauma and pain on top of already being a mess, I had experienced a serious heartbreak and spent years wallowing in it, stewing in it, just sorta waiting around to die.. life was falling apart.. But in may last year the shitty lifestyle really caught up with me, (your 30‚Äôs will humble you quick).. and I felt like my body was on the verge of shutting down. Family and friends were deeply concerned but as always in these situations, they could t force me to change. It had to start with me.. So 1st of may 2023 I decided I‚Äôm done with feeling shit, I‚Äôm taking charge and making the change. Because if I didn‚Äôt, I wouldn‚Äôt be alive for much longer. 

I got clean of some nasty habits, clean of addiction, changed my entire diet and went full vegetarian and stuck to a consistent meal plan, did whatever I could for my health, got a new job, started saving money along with investing in myself, reading more, sleeping better, joined a gym, started gaining weight and then discovered powerlifting and arm wrestling. I fell in love with those sports and the communities within them, met lots of wonderful people and have a circle of encouragement around me. The passion I have for this healthy living shit literally saved my life and I‚Äôll never go back.. Getting jacked is what ‚Äúgetting shit together‚Äù looked like for me, hard training was my calling..but it might not be like that for everyone. It could be music, art, cooking, volunteering, any other sport, reading, writing.. whatever tickles your pickle! This just happens to be what works for me

I‚Äôm not gonna patronise you, dear internet stranger, and try spout some holier than thou bs or that I‚Äôm the epitome of maturity and inspiration or health, because I still feel shity. I still have my bad days. I still fall into dark places. life is still a mess and I still slack in many areas.. I still struggle with my mental health, I‚Äôm still crippled with loneliness, anxiety, deep trauma, not much hope for the future, I still have no fucking idea how I‚Äôm gonna make it in this world.. But you know what?.. That‚Äôs ok. No one is perfect. Life is crazy..  I‚Äôm certainly not gonna make myself feel shit for slipping up, not knowing what to do in this world, and I‚Äôm certainly not gonna make myself feel bad for feeling bad. I‚Äôm human. As are you. In my opinion and experience, getting out of a dark pit starts with being kind to yourself, forgiving yourself, offering yourself the same compassion and love you do for those around you. We push onwards, strive to become better versions of ourselves, be more caring and compassionate, get our minds, bodies and souls healthy üí™

I know exactly what it feels like to have no one, to be alone while dealing with utter despair, and I wouldn‚Äôt wish that on anyone, even total strangers on the other side of the world. 

I mean it when I say this, if there is any fellow internet stranger here that made it this far, that wants to talk, if you‚Äôre in a bad place, a good place, a weird place, need diet or training tips, help with addiction, or just want to chit chat, my DM‚Äôs are open.

I hope we can all show and receive a bit more love and compassion, and hopefully we can all pass it along to the next person.  

Peace.‚ù§Ô∏è"

Scrivo perch√© spero solamente che chi tra voi si ritrover√† nella mia stessa situazione non commetter√† il mio stesso errore. 

Questo sabato siamo andati in campagna, lui si √® divertito ad esplorare la zona come al solito (ogni tanto riuscivo a tenerlo d'occhio, a volte spariva) e poi quando era il momento di tornare a casa √® salito in macchina come nulla fosse. Nelle ore seguenti gli si era gonfiata la gola, ma non pensavo fosse niente di grave e mi sono limitato a dargli del cortisone perch√© ero convinto potesse essere solo stato pinzato da un qualche insetto (non √® la prima volta che capita qualcosa di simile a un mio cane, e un p√≤ di cortisone insieme a del riposo sono sempre bastati).
In verit√† era stato morso da una vipera, ma non credevo fosse il caso perch√© il mio cane, piccolino com'era, sarebbe dovuto morire nel giro di mezz'ora o un'ora, o almeno cos√¨ credevo. 
Invece l'ho portato dal veterinario questa domenica, lui l'ha tenuto per una notte e poi luned√¨ √® morto.

Non cerco di venire compatito, non so nemmeno se questo post rispetta le regole del subreddit, ma per favore tenete d'occhio i vostri cani o almeno fategli un controllo prima di andarvene da posti dove potrebbero trovare delle vipere. E quando vedete sintomi di qualcosa, non date nulla per scontato e portateli immediatamente da un veterinario.

Poi chiss√†, magari ho solo scoperto l'acqua calda nel peggiore dei modi possibili e ho fatto la figura del cretino, ma sono contento di aver fatto la figura del cretino se questo aiuter√† altri cretini a salvare il proprio animale."

Unfortunately, I am a lazy bitch and I happen to have midterms soon, and after waiting 3 hours to let these hoes proof I no longer gave af about the 3 days I had spent preparing these. Mind you, this is my first time making croissants and I did a shit ton of research and so I learned you had to maintain humidity/DDT, which a lot of people did by putting a whole thing of hot water on the bottom rack of the oven. Does butter not melt in this universe anymore?? Yall wild but I digress. I wasn‚Äôt gonna take my chances so I stuck some hot water in there occasionally to get some steam while using a thermometer to maintain 26C within my oven. TELL ME WHY THEY ONLY ROSE FUCKING LIKE 50% AFTER 3 HOURS and barely did that wobbling thing. Anyways i baked that ish and it came out crisp and fragrant and delectable, until I cut into it and it turned out to be FLAT and WET and DEFLATED.

Truthfully I was ignorant and didn‚Äôt know the first thing about politics. Never googled a thing. I was brainwashed by my mother who believes in conspiracies. I started to spiral to a point where fear mongering made me consider actually prepping for end times. Until I questioned myself. Why have I been hearing the end is coming for years but it never happens? I vowed I would stop fear mongering if the one I had last heard came to pass. It did.

That‚Äôs when I discovered some debaters on TikTok (shout out to Parker, Harry, Dean and Chris) they made me start to think critically and ask myself why I was believing Trump was our last hope when he‚Äôs committed such heinous acts. I started to fact check and Google search as I learned things from these debates that I was unsure of. Sure enough there was facts to back them up. Quickly, within a matter of a few weeks to a month I realized that I was wrong. What I‚Äôve been hearing from my mother for years was not only baseless but absolute lies. This guy [trump] wasn‚Äôt just bad on a political and economic level, this guy is evil to his core. 

Unfortunately I‚Äôve lost respect for my mother. I‚Äôve tried to show her the truth too but she is actually too far gone. Likely, she will vote to take my rights and freedom away. She will vote against me.

However, I am so grateful I woke up not just in time, but a while before the election. I got to appreciate Biden instead of blaming and hating him. I got to see his charm and love for us. I got to see his EPIC mic drops before walking off stage. Those are my favorite. I also get to see a party filled with peace, love and acceptance. I get to appreciate what Biden and Harris have done. If I had woken up later on, although still good, I would‚Äôve unfortunately seen Joe Biden in a negative light his whole term. I would‚Äôve believed disgusting false allegations about him and devalued everything he‚Äôs worked so hard to do in his presidential term. Once he was gone I would look back fondly wishing I had realized sooner. 

I really owe so much thanks to Parker, Harry, Dean and Chris and one day I hope to write one of their names on a ballot too. Tomorrow when I go to vote, I hope that we will be able to see Georgia go blue again. I hope my vote will make a difference. Most importantly I‚Äôm glad to be on the right side of history üíô"

In August, approximately 700 hundred aid trucks entered northern Gaza. In September, only 400 aid trucks entered, after commercial operations ceased at the Allenby Crossing on the border between the occupied West Bank and Jordan, the WFP added. No food trucks have entered northern Gaza in October, the WFP told CNN.

On Wednesday, the WFP said in a report that the aid entering the strip has plummeted to its lowest level in months, forcing the organization to stop the distribution of food parcels in October.

‚ÄúHunger remains rampant and the threat of famine persists,‚Äù WFP added.  ‚ÄúIf the flow of assistance does not resume, one million vulnerable people will be deprived on this lifeline.‚Äù - [**Source**](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/10/11/middleeast/food-northern-gaza-starvation-un-intl) 

Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but kept it under a land, air and sea blockade since 2007.

In January 2024, Israeli authorities blocked 56% of humanitarian aid to northern Gaza.[156] On 9 February 2024, UNRWA director Philippe Lazzarini said that Israel had blocked food for 1.1 million Palestinians in Gaza. - [**Source**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip)

The European Union has said it is deeply concerned about draft Israeli legislation that would ban the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees from operating in Israel and likely scale back aid distribution across war-ravaged Gaza.

Earlier this week, an Israeli parliamentary committee approved a bill that would ban UNRWA from operating in Israeli territory and end all contact between the government and the UN agency. The bill needs final approval from the Knesset, Israel‚Äôs parliament.

‚ÄúThe European Union expresses its grave concern about the draft bill on UNRWA currently discussed in the Israeli parliament,‚Äù it said in a statement released on Saturday. - [**Source**](https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2024/10/12/eu-gravely-concerned-over-bill-seeking-to-ban-unrwa-in-israel)

Although the Israel Land Authority, a governmental body, announced on Thursday that it plans to turn the U.N. Relief and Works Agency field office in Jerusalem‚Äôs Ma‚Äôalot Dafna neighbourhood into a complex with 1,440 housing units. 

The Israeli governmental body informed UNRWA in May that it had to vacate the premises within 30 days and pay the Jewish state rent, for the years it used the facility, of about US$7 million. - [**Source**](https://nationalpost.com/news/israel-plans-to-turn-unrwas-jerusalem-office-into-housing-units-un-says-it-hasnt-been-notified)

UNRWA confirms that on  
14 October, the Israeli Army artillery fired shells inside and outside the UNRWA jabalia food distribution center. At least 10 people were reportedly killed and another 40 were injured. This happened while people were trying to get food from the centre. - [**Source**](https://x.com/unrwa/status/1845930999416533406?s=46&t=lyUkewqrOx_z4p8M2W3EIQ)

Nearly 230 workers for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency have died in Gaza following Israel‚Äôs counterattack, according to the agency. That number makes up a large portion of the estimated 280-plus aid workers and 885 health workers killed in the densely populated enclave, where civilians have become ensnared in the intense fighting between Israel and the militant group. - [**Source**](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/13/un-aid-workers-gaza-war-00183530)

The World Central Kitchen aid convoy attack occurred on 1 April 2024, when Israeli drones targeted a three-car convoy belonging to the World Central Kitchen (WCK) in the Gaza Strip, killing seven aid workers.[1][2] The workers had been overseeing the transfer of a shipment of food from a makeshift pier to a warehouse some distance away in the northern Gaza Strip, which has been pushed close to famine by Israel's invasion and blockade during the Israel‚ÄìHamas war. - [**Source**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Central_Kitchen_aid_convoy_attack#:~:text=All%20seven%20aid%20workers%20were,and%20dual%20American%2DCanadian%20citizenships.)

[Australia] Anti-Domestic Violence spokesperson charged with Domestic Violence against her partner,324,1g44kr4,pussypassdenied,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/crime/sydney-socialite-janelle-nellie-tilley-charged-with-domestic-violence/news-story/e67b7b4c6e486ca7f5638d0ebefc8ef3,7,1728988458.0,"

A Sydney socialite who was once lauded for her bravery in advocating against domestic violence is now a charge of assaulting her former partner.

Janelle ‚ÄúNellie‚Äù Tilley, 58, is accused of physically abusing Paris Saint, 34, during their four-year relationship, which began in 2019 when the pair met in Greece.

Police allege that Ms Tilley, an interior designer, threatened to ‚Äúget someone to break his legs‚Äù if Mr Saint reported the abuse, the Daily Telegraph reports.

Mr Saint, who lived with Tilley in her Bellevue Hill home, came forward to police in March after their tumultuous relationship ended.

He claimed he had been a victim of ongoing domestic violence, prompting Tilley‚Äôs charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

She has pleaded not guilty, with a hearing set for March next year.

In the meantime, an interim apprehended violence order prevents her from assaulting, stalking, or harassing Mr Saint.

The police facts sheet alleges that Tilley physically assaulted Mr Saint in 2023, accusing him of infidelity and scratching his neck until blood was visible.

In another incident, she allegedly spat on him during an argument in the car after a Valentine‚Äôs Day dinner.

Tilley previously made headlines in 2018 when she spoke out about her abusive relationship with millionaire pub baron Phillip De Angelis, who was convicted of assaulting her.

Her testimony led to widespread praise, including from then NSW Attorney-General Mark Speakman, who commended her for holding her assailant accountable."

Has had to regulate what she takes pictures of, deleting old pictures/videos etc. To which I suggested simply buying more cloud storage and backing everything up and doing a mass delete of photos/etc on her phone to free up some space. She didn‚Äôt even acknowledge my suggestion and almost without hesitation simply deleted our entire text log right in front of me. Saying that it was the quickest way for her to free up space. I can‚Äôt help but feel a little awestruck and hurt, as if I hadn‚Äôt just given her a perfectly good option for clearing up space, but to then turn around and ignore it completely and wipe our message history clear without even so much as batting an eye. For context I travel a lot for work so a lot of our days are shared via messages. 

The next day I told her that it kind of bothered me and hurt a little when she did that, to which she responded with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not responsible for how you feel‚Äù which honestly didn‚Äôt serve to make the situation any less painful.  Am I Overreacting? "

After scaring them off of my property and alerting the neighbors, one of my neighbors flagged down a SPD cruiser to alert them of the perpetrator. whom they soon found down the street. I obliged their request for info, and gave them what I could, but no one had enough information to charge the perpetrator since no one saw him damage any vehicles. I went to walk away, but the officer wanted my information. Keep in mind, I did not call them, I had only provided my account of the incident that did not lead to any charges. I gave him my name and address and went to leave. He insisted on my phone number, and I said, ""You have enough info to contact me if needed, and you have already said this isn't moving forward. Have a good night."" He then said, ""You are such a weirdo, next time, don't bother calling.""

I turned around and said ""excuse me?!? I need your name and badge number."" 

His response was to get in his cruiser and put it in reverse. He only stopped as I read his license plate and squad number aloud. He then stopped, realizing that this was going to be an immediate complaint. He gave me his name and badge number and then tried to apologize by blaming leadership, saying his Sergeant won't accept a report without a phone number. He then told me how I had improper demeanor. How I was at fault for giving him attitude, and being difficult.

I looked at him and suggested that he sit down with his supervisor and watch the body cam footage of me providing all the information he asked for until he pushed me for my phone number. Being compliant and informative the entire time, my attitude only changed upon him insisting that I was no longer worthy of police assistance. I was not the complainant. I did not call about the incident. I was cordial, compliant, and even thanked the officer until he pressed me for unneeded contact info and even then I told him good night and tried to walk away. I was nothing but a victim that was then ridiculed by the police officer for doing nothing more than bearing witness. He did not ask for the original complainants info at all. Officer and I ended with whether he thought we needed to include his supervisor and my attorney in reviewing the body cam footage. He deferred, acknowledged that the information provided was enough for contacting me, but not enough to satisfy his superiors, apologized profusely, and said, ""see it from my perspective."" I said, ""You just told me that I am no longer worthy of SPD assistance over you getting credit for a write up, go fuck yourself and your perspective.""

TL;DR: SPD use intimidation, name calling, and suggest that citizens do not contact them when a crime is being committed unless they can get unneeded contact info from insignificant witnesses."

I thought her advice was WONDERFUL and not like anything I had heard before, so I wanted to share‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúThe biggest piece of advice I have after 7 years of parenting is WAIT to get advice until you know what your struggles are. Children are so unique. Moms are so unique. There‚Äôs not a whole lot of value in getting a ton of advice on nursing if it turns out your boobs are champs and your baby is a rockstar nurser, you know? Then again maybe your boobs are great but your baby struggles to latch-- then that‚Äôs what you seek advice for. I have found that it‚Äôs like that no matter what stage you‚Äôre at-- the VAST majority is only helpful if it‚Äôs **relevant** for you and your little gal! As my kids have gotten older I‚Äôve observed that some kids are simply more mild and easy going than others. Part of that is their genes, part of it is their personality, part of it is their birth order, part of that comes from whether they are neurotypical or neurodiverse... So, my advise is to really try and understand what‚Äôs going on with you and your daughter and THEN go to the support groups and the individuals and the experts that you know have tackled yours or a similar issue!‚Äù"

I had spent a fair amount of time that evening in the restaurant, as I had zero F&B experience, and both the hotel and restaurant were slow enough to have some of the restaurant staff train me on what they do. 

About 8 PM, I went to check on the front desk to see how things were going and to make sure my clerk didn‚Äôt need a break. A gentleman walked in and said he wanted a room. I went ahead and processed the walk-in, handed the guest the keys, explained breakfast, and pointed him to the elevators. He walked about 20 feet away and stopped to lean into my houseman like he was going to tell him a secret. Without whispering, he asked the houseman where he could score some weed. 

I went over, and told the guest to hand me his keys because he was not going to be staying in my hotel. He asked why, and I explained that I heard him ask my employee for drugs, which meant he probably was going to smoke upstairs, which then meant I was going to charge him a $200 smoking fee, so I was doing him a favor. 

When he started to object, I pointed out that it was very racist to ignore the 6 white employees standing around to ask the Black kid where to buy weed. And I don‚Äôt allow racists to stay in my hotel. 

Dude left, and that was the last we heard from him. He didn‚Äôt even challenge my charging him for the room he never made it to. 

This was almost a decade ago, before even medical cannabis was legal here. I thought about it today, because I found out that houseman died yesterday. I ran into him a couple of years ago when he and his wife were my Rideshare passengers. He introduced me as ‚Äúthe guy who stood up to racist weed smokers.‚Äù  Apparently, he told that story a lot. 

Rest in Peace, my friend.

I didn't mention this in the original post because its irrelevant to the story

I hope its ok to share this here, because I'm not sure if it fits on this sub...A few years ago my boyfriend drove me to Seattle which is a two hour drive, and we went into a Trader Joe's because we don't have one even remotely close to where we live. I have no gallbladder so I needed to rush to the bathroom. This is tmi but I was in a lot of pain because I was backed up, but still needed to hurry to the bathroom. I had fainting episodes from having bowel movements because I was anemic, so I chose the big handicap stall because if I started fainting, I'd have space to lie down. (I know gross but I didn't care)

This what sounded like a woman maybe in her early 60s starts banging on the stall door, yelling at me, demanding I tell her ""what the f are you doing in there!!?? Get out!!"" I had already started fainting also, holding onto something (I forget what it was) and I couldn't really think properly, and just told her to leave me alone. She started banging on the door which terrified me, and yelling louder, asking me wtf I was doing in there.

 I had literally been in there for maybe a minute, so this was insane. After the last bang on the door I yelled ""I'M TAKING A SHIT THATS WHAT IM DOING"" Whoever was with her sounded like they let out a giggle and the older woman made this scoff noise like I shocked her. I remember feeling like my dad because he was quiet and didn't like conflict but if someone kept poking at him, he would yell something kind of outrageous and it'd make everyone laugh or shut up lol"

There hasn't been a day that's passed that I haven't thought about her. Recently she contacted me to reconnect me with her father. In doing so, she and I started to talk again and she admitted that the thoughts and feelings I have for her are mutual. Not a day has passed that she hasn't thought the same. But she's also married and has kids and super happy with her husband. Just like I am with my wife and my kids. But a part of our heart belongs to the other and we really have no idea what to do with that love other than just continue to lock it away. To protect our marriages, we decided to stop talking again. But I still think of her. Every day. I truly love my wife. I also truly love my ex. And I have no idea what to do with those emotions.

Update: Sorry, I wasn't clear. My wife knows about her. She knows what the ex meant to me in the past. And she knows about the exchange. There are no secrets. And my wife also knows I cherish my marriage thus why I discontinued the conversation with the ex. There's no way I would trade that for a taste of the past. My wife is incredibly beautiful, confident, and I know she is the person I want to grow old with. She's not threatened. I'm just in the process of putting these old feelings back in a box and just needed a place to say it aloud outside of the one person who always stuck hearing my stuff. Did not realize it would stir up so many comments."

**AITAH because I didn‚Äôt invite my father to my wedding because years ago he told me I was no longer part of his family.**

&#x200B;

I'm 28F and will be getting married next month. I didn‚Äôt invite my father to the wedding, but now he's trying to get in touch. I think I need to explain the context, because it all started when I was 6 years old, when my parents got divorced after my dad cheated on my mom with my stepmother. After that, I spent most of my time with my mom, but during holidays and vacations, I stayed with my dad. When I was 8, my half-brother Jake (20M) was born, and whenever I was with my dad, I was forced to take care of him.

When I started high school, I had to move in with my dad because my mom had to move abroad for work. This period was one of the hardest of my life. My stepmother wasn‚Äôt a bad person; she tried to include me in things, but she was very submissive to my father. As for my dad, he always treated me like an ""extra"" in the house, someone who didn‚Äôt really belong there. I was constantly responsible for taking care of Jake, and whenever he went out, he would only take my stepmother and Jake, never inviting me.

One of the most painful experiences happened when I was 14. My dad announced that the whole family was going to Disney for vacation, but the day before the trip, he told me that he wanted it to be a ‚Äúfamily moment,‚Äù their first big trip with Jake. So, I was left home alone. This had already become a pattern‚Äîtrips to the beach, zoos, or other outings always included just my stepmother and Jake while I was left behind.

My dad didn‚Äôt like me going out with friends or inviting them over. He said, ‚Äúteenagers together only cause trouble,‚Äù and because he was controlling, he would call the house phone at random times to check if I was home. He also had a trusted neighbor who would keep an eye on me to make sure I didn‚Äôt have any visitors.

When I turned 16, living with him, the feeling of being an ""extra"" only got worse. Everything I had experienced during vacations‚Äîthe exclusion and sense of abandonment‚Äîbecame part of my daily life. Things came to a head when I turned 18. My dad got a promotion at work and decided to take a ""family"" trip to Europe. Since it was my last year of high school, I was excited, thinking I‚Äôd finally be included. But then he told me he didn‚Äôt have enough money for a trip for four, so it would just be to celebrate Jake‚Äôs 10th birthday. I had to stay home.

That‚Äôs when I snapped. I told him he was being unfair and that he shouldn‚Äôt have given me false hope. I explained how I‚Äôd felt over the past years, and he called me ungrateful and spoiled, saying that I lived with him rent-free (which was a lie since my mom sent money to support me and I did all the housework because both he and my stepmother worked late). The argument escalated, and he kicked me out of the house, saying I was no longer part of the family and not even his daughter. He literally threw me out and tossed my things onto the sidewalk.

Luckily, a friend lived nearby, and I stayed at her place that night. The next day, I went back to see if my dad had calmed down, but I found my things still on the sidewalk, and some even in the trash. My stepmother had kindly saved a few items for me and handed them over. After that, my dad never reached out, except to call and yell at me a month later when my mom stopped sending him money for my expenses.

A few months later, I got into an engineering program in another state, where I met my now-fianc√©, Mark (29M). He was a senior, and we soon connected, realizing we had a lot in common. We started dating, graduated, and now work in the same field, though at different companies.

A few months ago, Mark proposed, and I happily said yes. I have social media, but I rarely use it‚ÄîI‚Äôve had Instagram for about six years but haven‚Äôt even posted 10 pictures. I think one of my relatives must have told my dad about the wedding because, about a month after I accepted the proposal, he reached out to me through Instagram, saying he was excited to help with the wedding.

I was surprised, both that he had messaged me and that he genuinely thought he would walk me down the aisle. I responded, saying he wouldn‚Äôt be walking me down the aisle because my stepfather would, and that the wedding would be small, just for my close family. After that, I blocked him.

After blocking him (and inspired by reading Reddit stories), I expected calls, messages, and even letters full of insults like ‚Äúungrateful‚Äù or ‚Äúspoiled.‚Äù However, the only thing I received was a letter delivered by Jake (yes, we still have contact). In the letter, my father expressed how sorry he was.

I won‚Äôt copy the exact words, but to summarize: he said that after kicking me out, he lived a normal life with my stepmother and Jake. But when he saw pictures of my graduation with my mom and stepfather, he started feeling regret. He wanted to talk to me, but his pride held him back. He only decided to reach out now because he realized that his pride got him nowhere and that he wanted to fulfill one of the plans he made when I was born: to pay for my wedding and walk me down the aisle.

Honestly, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve moved on with my life, and his attempt at redemption after so many years feels a bit too convenient.

AITA for not wanting to include my dad in my wedding despite his apology?

Note: My stepfather is an amazing person; he always goes out of his way to include me in everything, and my stepsisters are wonderful as well. When he found out that my father hadn‚Äôt taken me to Disney, he planned a trip for the next holiday and took me, along with my mother and sisters. This and a thousand other reasons why I want to walk down the aisle with him.

Edit 1: People are asking why my mom and stepfather left me with my dad and what their jobs are. My mom works as a programmer and managed to get a job abroad. She thought it was best to accept it, especially since she wanted to save up a good amount of money to cover college expenses and for the future. My stepfather is a researcher and was doing his postdoctoral work at the time.

The first person to talk to me was my older sister (stepsister). Two days after I was kicked out, she came to see me and even stayed for a few days (which I can barely remember because I was just crying). But I didn't move in with her because she lives in another state, and I was almost done with classes and final exams. So, my friend (and bridesmaid) let me stay at her house. Her parents helped me gather my things and even set up the guest room for me.

*NTA. Your bio father's regrets are his problem, not yours. Your real father, your stepfather, the man who treated you as a father should, is the one who should walk you down the aisle. That other guy is just a bad memory to put behind you.*

**copper-feather**

*Bio father treated OOP like a pet he didn't want. Stepfather treated OOP like his third daughter.*

*Bio father multiple times deliberately excluded OOP from 'family' trips. Stepfather went out of his way to include OOP in trips.*

*Bio father kicked OOP out of his house yet still expected to be paid. Stepfather did not act like a douchebag.*

*There is no contest here.*

&#x200B;

**cutie\_Kasey**

*You‚Äôre absolutely not the asshole. Your dad made his choices and completely shut you out for years, treating you like an outsider in his own family. Now that he wants to play the 'dad' card because you‚Äôre getting married, it feels more like a convenient afterthought than genuine remorse. You‚Äôve built a loving and supportive family with your mom and stepfather, who actually care about you. It‚Äôs totally valid to want them by your side on such a significant day. Your happiness matters, and you deserve to celebrate with those who truly appreciate you.*

&#x200B;

**ConstructionNo9678**

*I bet it's because news of the engagement has spread and people have started asking him about his daughter's wedding. OP says he seemed genuine, but the only thing I can picture him being excited about here is finding ways to make this about himself again. If I were OP I would totally keep NC, it really doesn't seem worth whatever bullshit he's going to spew at the wedding and reception.*

*If he truly were remorseful, then he wouldn't be assuming shit. He would be reaching out and telling OP how sorry he was, that he missed her, and that he wants to be there for her on the wedding and meet with her again beforehand. He would understand that it takes time to build a relationship back again, and accept being able to attend the wedding as a guest.*

&#x200B;

**FloofyDireWolf**

*If he were remorseful he could‚Äôve sent her a check to pay for the wedding, an apology with explanation of his regret and no ask for himself whatsoever.*

**Update - 1 days later**

&#x200B;

I‚Äôm back with an update, but first, let me explain why I‚Äôm using a different account. The account I originally posted from belonged to my friend. I‚Äôm not very active on social media, so I didn‚Äôt create an account just to post something I didn‚Äôt expect would get so much attention. I thought there would be, at most, one follow-up to share whether or not I invited my dad to the wedding. However, some people started asking why there were inconsistencies, like the age difference or why I mentioned my parents were married in one post and not in this one. Well, that's why. The story you read belonged to my friend‚Äîthe same friend who let me stay with her. She also encouraged me to share my own story since I wanted opinions from neutral people, not those close to me or my dad. And wow, did I get a lot of feedback‚Ä¶ LOL.

Now, regarding the comments. I want to thank everyone for helping me see things I hadn‚Äôt noticed before, especially in how my dad's letter was written. For those wondering, yes, he mostly talked about his feelings and how he felt. Very little was said about me, and even less was about apologizing. He also mentioned how I‚Äôm his only daughter, while my stepfather has two daughters to walk down the aisle, but he only has me.

For those asking why I didn‚Äôt move abroad with my mom and stepfather: they were supposed to be away for 3 to 5 years, with my mom likely needing to change companies every year. My stepfather was also deep in his research, so their lives were pretty unstable. At the time, I didn‚Äôt anticipate how much I‚Äôd suffer or that I‚Äôd be kicked out. I think the rare times I spent with my dad and the feeling of being left behind would fade whenever I was with my mom and stepfather. This cycle became my routine, which is why I stayed with my sperm donor. And for those asking if my mom knew what was going on: I only told her about the Disney incident. I didn‚Äôt want to bring issues from one home into another.

Now for the update.

For some background on my mom: she returned two years after I started college, and my real dad came back a year after that. It was my sisters who attended my high school graduation. My mom now lives two hours away, so I went to visit her to discuss what had happened and to get her and my stepfather's thoughts on the situation. My mom said it was something I had to decide on my own and that she wouldn‚Äôt interfere. My stepfather told me he‚Äôd help pay for the wedding, regardless of what I chose to do (yes, he‚Äôs helping with some expenses). My sisters, on the other hand, share the same opinion as most of you: not to invite him and to send him a letter detailing everything I went through (my older sister‚Äîlet‚Äôs call her Lisa‚Äîwas the most against inviting him).

Lisa was the first person to check on me. Today, I learned that on the same day she came to see me at my friend‚Äôs house, she also stopped to talk to my dad. She hadn‚Äôt mentioned it before because, according to her, he only spouted nonsense, and sharing it at the time would‚Äôve just made things worse for me. That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs completely against me reconnecting with him. For those curious about what he said, she didn‚Äôt go into details but mentioned that it angered her so much she ended up shouting at him, calling him every name under the sun. She thinks this may be one of the reasons he didn‚Äôt reach out sooner‚Äîshe think that added fuel to the fire.

We talked a lot, not just about my dad but about myself as well. I realized that even with the therapy I went through during college, there was something important I hadn‚Äôt done: I never truly opened up to my parents. I always thought I had to face and overcome everything alone. All I did, though, was bottle everything up. Today, I was finally able to unpack it all and share my feelings.

After a lot of tears, I hugged them both. And here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve decided:

I will respond to his letter. Unfortunately for Mark and Lisa, it won‚Äôt be the harsh response they were hoping for. I‚Äôll take some of your advice and express how I felt when he kicked me out. I‚Äôll be polite but honest. I‚Äôll also let him know that my stepfather will walk me down the aisle because that‚Äôs what I want. I won‚Äôt offer further explanations to him; after all, this is my wedding with Mark, and it will be exactly how we want it, without the need for justifications.

I will not accept any money from him, nor will I send him an invitation. If my dad truly wants to reconcile, he can reach out to me through Jake. But only after the wedding (or honeymoon), and it will be on my terms.

As someone suggested, we‚Äôre going to hire security for the wedding, no matter how my dad reacts.

For those wondering, yes, Jake has been invited. As I mentioned, we still have a good relationship, and he‚Äôs allowed to take photos.

*Well done. He doesn't deserve anything, but you can be a bit harsh in your letter. Even brutally honest. That's what he deserves.*

&#x200B;

**Corfiz74**

*Yes, please, be very very direct about what he put you through.*

*He also mentioned how I‚Äôm his only daughter, while my stepfather has two daughters to walk down the aisle, but he only has me.*

*I'd tell him that he very explicitly told you that you were not family, so now, in fact, your stepdad has THREE daughters, and he has NONE. If he's not around for your hard times, he can't be around for your good times, simple as that. He is narcissist scum, don't let him back into your life, he'll only bring chaos.*

&#x200B;

**DUDEI82QB4IP**

*Good luck with everything, I hope your wedding day goes beautifully.*

*These kind of people always want to be invited for the big events because they think they deserve the recognition and do t want to be embarrassed by people asking about their absence, but truthfully, if this was about a genuine reconciliation, he‚Äôd do it on a regular day NOT start making demands to be included in your wedding day.*

https://pauliesaucerecipes.com/post/dutch-oven-roasted-chicken/

Ingredients
* 1 whole chicken giblets removed. The chicken i used for this recipe was about 4-5 pounds
* 1 tablespoon of salt
* 2 small yellow onions
* 2 lemons
* 6-8 cloves of garlic
* 4 yellow potatoes
* 4-5 sticks of celery
* 4-5 carrots
* 2 tablespoons of poultry seasoning
* ¬Ω cup of dry white wine
* 1 ¬Ω stick of garlic and herb butter
* 5 thyme sprigs
* 5 rosemary sprigs
* Fresh chopped chives for garnish
* ¬º cup of olive oil

Instructions
* Place your chicken on a chicken rack so air can circulate around the whole bird
* Season your chicken with salt and place in your refrigerator uncovered for 4 hours i recommend letting it brine overnight
* Remove chicken from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking allowing it to come up to room temperature¬†
* Peel the skin off your carrots and slice into thirds¬†
* Chop your celery, onions, and potatoes into thirds¬†
* In a dutch oven add carrots, celery, potatoes, garlic, white wine, olive oil and then season with poultry seasoning¬†
* Mix so everything get evenly seasoned¬†
* Add in 1 sliced lemon and 3 rosemary sprigs¬†
* Stuff your chicken with lemon, onion, rosemary & thyme sprigs¬†

* Place your chicken on top of all the veggies¬†
* Spread garlic and herb butter on top of the chicken¬†
* Place in your oven at 425 degrees (220¬∞C) for 30 minutes¬†
* After 30 minutes baste your chicken with the liquid at the bottom of the dutch oven. I find a turkey baster or injector work best for this.¬†
* Place your chicken back in the oven for another 30 minutes¬†
* Baste your chicken again and cover with aluminum foil. This will protect the chicken skin from burning¬†
* Place your chicken back in the oven till the internal temperature reaches 162 degrees (72¬∞C)
* Remove the aluminum foil from the dutch oven and let the chicken rest for 15-20 minutes¬†
* Slice up your chicken into desired thickness¬†

Losing both senior dogs two weeks apart,1331,1g3wcd8,seniordogs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g3wcd8,124,1728955730.0,"Two weeks ago we said goodbye to Scout. The day prior we found out he had end stage kidney failure and he had gone downhill extremely rapidly. A week and a half before that he showed zero symptoms so it was a complete shock. The next day our other dog Calvin had a vet appointment. Before we left I snuggled him and told him he had to hang around now for at least a couple more years. I thought we‚Äôd walk out of his appointment with arthritis meds. Instead we walked out with an end stage cancer diagnosis and instructions to euthanize asap (I‚Äôm so mad his previous vet missed the signs in July and dismissed them as arthritis). His lungs are surrounded by tumors and his muscle loss and hind end weakness are from cancer, not arthritis. He still had a spark in him so I went against the vets suggestion to euthanize the next day and decided to wait until that spark was gone. He has started to go downhill over the last week no longer wanting to eat even his favorite foods most of the time. His resting respiratory rate is now 60-80 and tomorrow at 1:00 he is meeting Scout on the other side of the rainbow bridge. He is my heart dog and this is absolutely killing me. We‚Äôre losing them exactly two weeks apart and going from 2 dogs to 0. Scout was 14 and Calvin is 15 so both seniors, but being doxies I thought we had a few years left with them. My childhood Doxie lived to be 18. I just keep breaking down and don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll get through tomorrow. It‚Äôs taking everything in me not to cancel that appointment. I keep reminding myself we don‚Äôt want to wait until it‚Äôs so bad it‚Äôs an emergency, but he just happily ate his rotisserie chicken and he still gets around fine so it‚Äôs so difficult for me to go through with this decision. One picture is from their younger years and the other is the day we had to put Scout down. I brought him out for one last nap in the sun before his appointment. "

The one where a marketing company would rather get their customer's domain blacklisted than learn to use SendGrid,157,1g47894,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1g47894/the_one_where_a_marketing_company_would_rather/,24,1728997491.0,"I feel like I'm losing my mind.

A client of the MSP I work at recently contracted an external ~~marketing~~ *AI Driven personalized email sales generation* firm. They send bulk template emails to a list of potential customers and try to convince them to buy something. But they're not marketing, and will correct you every time you so much as insinuate they are.

Whatever. Not the issue I have with them. Because rather than send mail from their own infrastructure or a dedicated bulk sending service, they apparently require a standard licensed user mailbox to ~~send spam~~ *generate personalized sales leads.*

We warn them that this won't fly, that account is going to get blocked within 24 hours, and that the client runs the risk of having their entire domain blacklisted. Marketing company says it's fine, they've done this with hundreds of clients, including on the Fortune 500. Client says do it, boss says the inevitable stupid tax will be a good source of revenue, us techs are just paid to push buttons so we create them their account.

Twenty four hours pass. Security alert hits the queue, marketing.bozos@clientdomain.com has been restricted from sending out of 365 due to suspect outbound messages. Checking into it...the account was sending out standard boilerplate spam. We have a moment of 'I told you so,' get affected parties together, reiterate that this won't fly and recommend that they do what we told them to in the first place.

No, says the marketing company. This happens all the time. 365 just needs some time to adjust to their sending patterns. They ""mimic human behavior"" after all. But, we should create them a *second* marketing account so they can split their sends between them. This will totally fix it, promise. Argument ensues, but at the end of it the second account is created.

Twenty four hours pass. Two security alerts hit the queue. marketing.bozos@clientdomain.com and marketing.bozos2@clientdomain.com have been restricted from sending out of 365 due to suspect outbound messages. Both accounts were sending out standard spam. The 'I told you so' is said with a sigh today. We again recommend they do what they're supposed to.

No, says the marketing company. This *has* been happing increasingly often. What we really need is a *third* marketing account so they can be super absolutely sure this doesn't happen again, super duper pinkie promise. The ensuing argument has more tension this time around. A third account is created at the client's insistence.

Twenty four hours pass. Three security alerts hit the queue. marketing.bozos@clientdomain.com, marketing.bozos2@clientdomain.com, and marketing.bozos3@clientdomain.com have been restricted from sending out of 365 due to suspect outbound messages. All three accounts are sending out standard spam. The 'I told you so' is said through gritted teeth. Boss finally puts his foot down, says that we are not going to be creating an infinite series of licensed marketing user accounts. You are going to need to find both a new IT provider and a new domain at the current rate. Argument ensues, further ~~spam~~ *sales generation* sends are paused until a resolution can be reached. A meeting is scheduled.

The meeting happens, between myself, one of our senior techs/technical executive, stakeholders at the client, and the non-technical account manager from the marketing company. Account manager insists on giving us the sales pitch for their company. ""We send bulk template emails to a list of potential customers and try to convince them to buy something"" says the account manager in her native tongue of corporate buzzword slop. Great. Amazing. Tell us what shitty bulk sending platform you use and the spf record you want to us add and we can be done with this.

No no no, says the account manager. It's not our *business process* to use those. We prefer a *personalized approach.* You see, we mimic *realistic human behavior.* Our weird proprietary tool that we've grafted to this poor mailbox sends a message *once exactly every 120 seconds* - just like a human! We personalize our messages by using the same subject line every single time! These are *not* standard marketing messages, they're an *AI driven, personalized sales generation platform*. Transcendent. Enrapturing. You're sending spam. You're going to get the client blacklisted. I refuse to believe that we are the first people to have pointed this out to you.

Well, the account manager admits, we have been noticing these issues recently. Since last month, apparently. But we're totally 100% certain that if we just keep at it, 365 will give up eventually! We tell the client this is untenable, unsupportable, and poses a serious risk to their business operations. Marketing company refuses to budge. It is eventually 'agreed' to buy a clientdomainmarketing.com, use it to create a seperate 365 environment, and let marketing company go wild without risk of contaminating the primary domain's reputation.

Am I crazy? Does this sound like anything remotely reasonable? I feel like I'm going insane."

His music reviews aren‚Äôt well researched nor serious.

Unlike Anthony Fantano, Swiftologist states his opinion and doesn‚Äôt give valid rationalization. ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs bleep bloop music‚Äù is not good criticism just because you don‚Äôt like the BB Trickz remix. You can dislike music without abjectly being unnecessarily insulting to all of EDM/electro-pop. You don‚Äôt have to like the remix, and even the album but give the rationale; instead of just listening for two seconds and saying ‚Äúoh no here we go again.‚Äù 

He clearly is a Taylor Stan and it‚Äôs in his name, which is absolutely fine. But where it gets a little crazy is that he will put every female singer down before Taylor just to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù her. It‚Äôs rather immature and shows no serious inclination to engage with the album at hand. Instead he will write it off simply because it‚Äôs not what he listens to on the regular, nor is it mainstream. This is the epitome of the subject at hand in Girl, So Confusing, which was his most liked song off the remix.

Honestly too, he said that Chappell Roan is more influential than Lady Gaga in his hot takes video. That is true for maybe this season, but if we are talking overall careers, that‚Äôs a crazy statement. But I love Chappell, and I‚Äôm not degrading her, it‚Äôs just a longevity thing. 

To wrap it up, if you feel being condescending and belittling is a good way to win over people to watch your videos, be my guest. He wonders why he gets so much negative criticism, when his reviews are just him laughing at music without giving anything insightful. Tell me the issue with the production, the mix, the lyrics, etc, instead of just belittling a whole genre."

I already knew they're eventually gonna make it a trend back when they experimented on that Tracer mythic skin, and they actually did.

Before any dev comes here and silently defend their decision in their heads, **NO**, it is **NOT** satisfying to grind prisms in the battle pass only for us to unlock a minor design change. Most of the players **do not** like it. Listen to the majority of your player base for once.

These kind of mythic skins feels like a scam because the final level should be the base mythic skin then you start the customizations from there, not make it a glorified upgradable legendary skin. They can't even be bothered to make a second weapon variant ffs. 

I just hope that the next mythic skins will stop following this trend..

So, this happened a few months ago, and I still can‚Äôt believe how it all went down. My ex-girlfriend (let‚Äôs call her Sarah) and I had been dating for about a year, and everything seemed pretty solid. We both had Fitbits and would sometimes sync up for friendly step challenges, just to keep each other motivated.

One night, Sarah told me she was going out with her friends for a ‚Äúgirls‚Äô night.‚Äù No big deal, right? I figured I‚Äôd stay in and binge some Netflix. Around 10 p.m., I texted her just to check in and ask how her night was going. She replied a little later, saying she was having fun but probably wouldn‚Äôt be out too late because she was ‚Äúexhausted.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs where it gets wild.

Later that night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep, so I decided to check my Fitbit stats, and I noticed that Sarah had logged a crazy amount of activity between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. I‚Äôm talking like, thousands of steps, which was odd because she said she was tired and going home. Curious, I shot her a text the next morning asking how her night was. She told me she went home early and passed out.

Red flag.

So, I dug a little deeper into the Fitbit app, and it showed her heart rate spiked for about an hour around the same time those steps were logged. Now, I‚Äôm no detective, but I‚Äôve seen enough bad movies to know what that means. Let‚Äôs just say, she wasn‚Äôt getting cardio at the gym.

I confronted her about it, and she eventually admitted that she had been ‚Äúmeeting up‚Äù with some other guy that night. Apparently, her Fitbit wasn‚Äôt just tracking her steps, but also her lies.

We broke up on the spot. Now, whenever someone asks why we split, I just tell them, ‚ÄúHer Fitbit snitched on her.‚Äù

Ohio projected to lose 5.7% of its population by 2050,161,1g460i8,Ohio,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/1g460i8/ohio_projected_to_lose_57_of_its_population_by/,147,1728993814.0,"All -

The Ohio Department of Development produced a revised set of population growth forecasts (it was profiled in The Columbus Dispatch recently which is what triggered my post). You can see their summary report here: [https://dam.assets.ohio.gov/image/upload/development.ohio.gov/research/pop1/State-of-Ohio-Population-Projections-Report-2023.pdf](https://dam.assets.ohio.gov/image/upload/development.ohio.gov/research/pop1/State-of-Ohio-Population-Projections-Report-2023.pdf)

They are forecasting Ohio will lose 5.7% or 675,000 people by 2050. The Central Ohio region is forecasted to  gain 725,000 people. This is less than the commonly quoted 1 million people added by 2050, however, there is a range of forecasts for these type of projections that include adding more than 1 million (the range also could be negative).

I was surprised to see the overall Ohio projections become negative b/c a few years ago they had projected a slight increase. I'm hopeful these projections will be inaccurate b/c they come on the heals of COVID and I think that produced some anomalies (i.e. for the first time in the states history we had a net population decrease due to deaths exceeding births).

Personally, I am very bullish on Ohio and I love it here. I think it's one of the most beautiful states in the country and have no plans to go anywhere. I love raising my family here and I would advise my kids to stick around if it works for their careers / future plans. Climate change is strongly in Ohio's favor as we have a temperate climate, plenty of water resources and a lack of significant natural disasters. Additionally, the sense of community is much stronger here than I've experienced in others places like Austin,TX or the west coast where I've lived / worked extensively. The cost of living in most places is reasonable and you can afford a life here.

Just my 2 cents, keep the change. :)

EDIT:

Seeing a lot of comments around politics and some general Ohio hate comments. As a lifetime Ohioan, I've seen / heard it all (I'm middle aged btw). I have seen / lived / worked in both coasts / down south, and the time away from Ohio made me appreciate it in unexpected ways. Not everyone has the opportunity to see the country / world and I'm privileged that way.

Regarding politics, I am optimistic given the changes we've already seen in such a short period of time. We've protected women's healthcare rights by passing the Abortion November 2023 Ohio Issue 1. Additionally, Ohio's legacy of Gerrymandering could end this year (initial polling I've shows overwhelming support > 60%). These are both major wins for support of peoples individual rights and to have representation in Ohio that is more reflective of it's population. I won't deny there are big political / cultural rifts between the cities and rural areas, but this is true of the entire country to some degree.

My hope for my fellow Ohioans is we treat each other with the respect we each deserve and we can work together to make this state better than it currently is.

Be well."

The rally didn't think about the logistics of 15k people and the buses weren't enough.

People got angry and began to riot. Throwing themselves in front of buses, banging on the windows and doors, and attacked two bus drivers. (One female driver was spit on by an elderly woman. The woman had to be restrained by another person from grabbing the driver by the hair)

The other driver was my father. He is a veteran and served in Vietnam and has head trauma from the war and from an car accident years ago...he was sucker punched from behind the head while he was walking outside his bus. He has a broken nose and hopefully his prior head trauma isn't worsen but won't know until some time. (He did get a CAT scan) He didn't see who hit him and he lost vision temporarily in his right eye (it's back now). 

I just cannot understand this cult of violence and hate. My dad is 70 and what a coward to hit someone from behind because of something that was not my dad's fault. 

The news didn't report this and even riot police showed up because of this behavior with the buses...

Just had to vent and get this off my chest. I just am angry and sad at the state of our political climate "

When I arrived home yesterday, I noticed that someone had padlocked our communal back gate. I own my home but not the communal walkway, and I‚Äôm unsure who does.

My neighbors, who share the same side of the fence as me, also have no idea who put the padlock on. We previously had access through the gate as we were given the lock code by one of these neighbors. However, now someone has placed a padlock on it, and we can no longer exit our garden to reach our car (though we don‚Äôt park in this car park, as it's private parking for others).

I‚Äôm wondering if this gate constitutes a right of way. I‚Äôve reviewed my documents from when I purchased the house, but there‚Äôs no mention of the communal walkway in the land registry.

Can anyone advise on what to do in this situation?

Thanks in advance!

I was going to post photos but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs allowing me to."

She's fucking or is planning on fucking her subordinate at work. 

I found screenshots of the I love you texts they sent to eachother, them calling eachother baby. I found records of the thousands of messages they'd sent back and forth with him in her phone as another female coworker.

Pictures she sent him of her new tits and ass I just paid for to up her confidence.

All of it. 

If you're in a DB, make sure you're sure you're not like me and looking like a chump begging for her to love you while she gives herself to someone else. 

On a positive note, my bedroom is no longer dead, just my marriage.

Edit: I live in a community property state. Infidelity has no impact on divorce settlements. So, as much as I'd love to be ruthless here. It's effectively meaningless.

Also, thanks for all the kind words. I'm enraged and heartbroken, but also kind of relieved.

Yesterday I was making a phone stand with leftover fiberglass while I was waiting on my parts to dry.

His wife (f 43) come out to the garage looking pretty as she always does and walks by my work table and asked what I was making and I showed her the phone stand.

She liked it and asked if I could make one to work with her new phone.

I agreed and she was happy because it's a new phone that folds and has a screen on the back.  

She hadn't found a stand that works with it .

I asked to see it for second to measure it and I sat it on my table closed but a notification come across that said something about amazing tits and a reddit name.    

I cut my eyes up to see if she seen that and she hadn't she was looking around being her nosey self.

I got the measurements of her phone and case and give it back to her and told her I would make her one.

She thanked me and went on about her day.

She's a big girl but she really is beautiful and really does have amazing tits (guess work at this point) 

So anyway back to watching fiberglass dry and sitting alone I pull my phone out and get on reddit.

I find the guy that commented amazing tits and he said the exact same thing on a few posts but then there she was. Face covered but it's her.   I see the things that I won't mention here that proves it's her.

I know I should just forget about it but I can't and I want to ask her about it.    

She's even sexier than I imagined and it is so hot knowing where she posts nudes.   

I'll probably not say anything to her and  keep it to myself I just needed to get it out .





 EDIT.    So this blew up over night and outed me big time first thing this morning.     
It's not as bad as you might think though.   I'll follow up with another post within  a couple of hours to explain better.

His mother Alaa Al-Dalou was martyred with him. Shaaban had previously survived an IOF attack on a mosque across from the hospital where 20 martyrs had ascended last week.

6 strand braid to fix my favorite band tee,925,1g3x389,Visiblemending,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g3x389,25,1728958058.0,"So yeah I fell on my skates and busted my elbow so bad I had to be cut out of this shirt. I finally am able to do some consistent sewing again, and fixing this was high on the list. 

I did a 6 strand braid using embroidery floss in colors to match the graphic. I kept each length of thread on a needle, and as the strands came to the outside of the braid, took bites of the fabric. Included photo of the inside to show what the back looks like. 

I've been mulling over this technique a while for a different project so this was a perfect way to practice, you can see the shoulder is messier than the side because I did it first. Then decided to measure and mark properly for the side.

I liked the idea of more fringe so I left the threads long and did some braids and knots to add some detail. "

How we won the war ,1437,1g3tw57,StLouis,https://i.redd.it/xv194pod3tud1.jpeg,175,1728948439.0,"In 1947, the United States was divided‚Äînot by politics, but by something far more important: the Great Soft Drink War. On one side, the northern territories proudly stood behind ‚ÄúPop,‚Äù a fizzy word that bubbled up across the Midwest and beyond. In the South, ‚ÄúCoke‚Äù reigned supreme, a sugary monarchy ruling from Texas to Georgia, where everything carbonated was referred to as ‚ÄúCoke,‚Äù no matter the brand. But there was a quiet force brewing in the middle of the country‚Äîa city often overlooked by both camps: St. Louis. And St. Louis was a ‚Äúsoda‚Äù city, with big dreams and even bigger ambitions.

For decades, St. Louis had quietly watched the Pop and Coke regions argue over trivial matters: ‚ÄúIs root beer Pop?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy does everything have to be a Coke down here?‚Äù Yet, amid the chaos, they never noticed St. Louis strategizing, whispering their plans in the shadowy corners of soda fountains.

The leader of this clandestine movement was a sharp-tongued soda jerk named Louie ‚ÄúThe Fizz‚Äù O‚ÄôSullivan. Louie had long been frustrated by the lack of attention given to the Midwest‚Äôs beloved ‚Äúsoda.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy should we let ‚ÄòPop‚Äô fizz out our future? And don‚Äôt get me started on ‚ÄòCoke,‚Äô‚Äù Louie would grumble, shaking his head every time someone ordered ‚ÄúCoke‚Äù but meant Sprite. His vision was clear: ‚ÄúSoda‚Äù would rise, and one day, from sea to shining sea, people would be ordering soda with pride.

St. Louis began its soda revolution quietly. They sent ambassadors to key cities on the coasts, spreading the soda message with a level of stealth only rivaled by the most cunning soft drink diplomats. First, they conquered the soda fountains of New York City. ‚ÄúPop‚Äù didn‚Äôt stand a chance in the urban jungle. Then they moved westward, slipping into California‚Äôs beach culture with ease. Soon, soda was spreading like wildfire.

Meanwhile, the Pop and Coke regions had become distracted. In the North, ‚ÄúPop‚Äù warriors were caught up in debates over whether Chicago-style hot dogs should come with ketchup. In the South, ‚ÄúCoke‚Äù loyalists were embroiled in an existential crisis over whether sweet tea should get a rebrand. No one was paying attention to St. Louis‚Äô quiet, unstoppable expansion.

By the time anyone noticed what was happening, it was too late. In diners, restaurants, and even the newest drive-ins, soda had taken over the menus. The West Coast had fallen, and the East was firmly in soda‚Äôs grip. Even some of the fiercest ‚ÄúPop‚Äù territories in the Midwest were starting to crack under the pressure.

By 2023, the Great Soda War was won. Louie ‚ÄúThe Fizz‚Äù O‚ÄôSullivan‚Äôs dream had come true. ‚ÄúPop‚Äù was but a distant memory in most places, hanging on by a thread in a few stubborn strongholds, and ‚ÄúCoke‚Äù had retreated to the deepest corners of the South. St. Louis, once overlooked, had risen to be the unsung hero of the carbonated drink world.

And so, the nation toasted in unison, with a crisp, refreshing soda in hand."

My mom wants to retire and wanted to give her company to my cousin, her nephew. He is her sisters son. We are Chinese and apparently Chinese people help family financially. So a free store and cheap rent (my parents own the property). My mom hoped this way he could make some money before he got really old. 

But he doesn't want it, because he doesn't like hard work. He wants my company, because in his mind I work less and work is easier. 

To keep the story short I agreed, I bought my parents property and business for very cheap in exchange for my cousin to get my company for free and pay low rent. In other words my mom paid me the money my cousin should have paid. 

Last month, after a year of planning. He didn't want the company unless we were to pay him the difference he makes a month, because in the meantime he got a good paying job. 
He makes 3k and he thinks I make 1k, I don't know why he thinks that. Actually I know, my whole family thinks I'm the big loser of the family. But if he was smart he wouldn't be a loser. So I told him I wasn't going to pay him to start his own company.

Deal was off and I have two companies and not enough people to work in them. 
Hired a realtor and sold the company for 500k.
It's not definitive, but I tell you it feels great. "

Muse opened their opened their mouth, a pressure a rhe side was their que to bite down. When the did the texture was soft as flavour burst into their mouth, far more sour than they'd guessed pushed their eyes open. When they did they saw yhe most beautiful sight in the galaxy. Beside them holding a vine of grapes beside them was a tall, flawless figure, a smile that endured hardship but was worn like a jewel. An earned smile of one who walked and conquered. Not of malice but to uplift. Eyes like the purest sea of platinum they could drown in. 

Muse could watch her for days and their eyes would never want for rest. Muse reached up plucking one of the grapes holding it to her who took it all with a cat like temperament. She hummed as she swallowed it down looking back up to Muse. The both of them stared at eachother before they burst into laughter. Amidst the laughter Fulgrim moved atop Muse taking their chin into their hand bending their face up toward her own lips. The whole world faded into silence. The entirety of everything could have ended with the greatest of calamities and Muse would never even have known. Drowning in the embrace of their primarch was an ideal end.


""So this is how you justify it."" A voice deep, risky, almost gargling as if choking on blood. To Muses dismay the ideal they saw vanished. ""This is all that's left of you, 10,000 years, and you remain lost in a memory while the Children and Fulgrim commit atrocity after atrocity. The voice crushed Muses heart. With every word it spoke Muses felt as if every nerve in their body was exposed and blistering in fire. Muse wanted to scream at the memory of it all. Everything collapsing into maddened screams that couldn't force themselves from Muses gullet. 

Muse didn't have the right and they couldn't give in. If they did after all this time then wouldn't that mean everything was worthless, every choice made for millennia. ""All this for a ghost, For this, shadow?!"" The words cut far too deep for muse to brace as they reeled on the speaker. ""DONT CALL HER THAT.....DONT YOU EVER CALL HER THAT!!!! She was brilliant and beautiful. She was kind and stern. She saw the world in all its imperfections and tried to make the best out of it."" The voice in a baleful rage returned ,""But she lied to us. Shee twisted...and tortured us, and used us! Manipulated us for her own purposes, and for what? For this?"" The sights Muse had seen of slaanesh and her abhorrent gifts ran through Muses mind. The Prince of Pleasure blighted domain and their masterful cruel creatures. 

Muse looked to the voice and was met with a different kind of horror. Hanging in the air was a creature of cruel resilience. A monstrous mockery of the finerys Muse had been draped in for all these years. Rylanor was a person in the most generous of terms. Though he lacked legs they stood taller and prouder than Muse. Despite their disfigurement their resilience more evident than Muse. Organs exposed, wires protruding. What had been done to Rylanor was no doubt monstrous, but he wasn't hindered by that. There was righteous anger, glorious purpose that seemingly made Rylanor themself glow like a champion of the Emperor. Every part of them laughed at the pathetic mess that was Muse and that deserved every bit of resentment. 

""Look at what has become of us,"" Muse said as they slumped onto their ass, hand running through their hair, ""the sad state we find ourselves. I was right we were sunk from the beginning."" Rylanor returned with their gruff tone fused virtuous resentment. ""Is that what you think. This was our fate. To be come chew toys for the chaos gods."" Muse didn't speak their answer evident in their silence. ""How you disappoint me Muse. 10000 years and you can't get out of your own way. You can't see the truth. You can't stop drinking poison even though you know it's killing you."" Muse rose to their feet roaring back. ""So long as I can help her. I can.... I have to try. I have to after everyt-!"" 

Rylanor cut them off, their own words shattering Muses loose footing. ""NO. After all this time, she isn't coming back."" ""BUT I CAN-,""Muse tried to stand and speak again but was only battered down. ""NO! You have deceived yourself into believing that you can save her. Perhaps save all of them, but you can't and that weight will crush you. Do you know why?"" Muse was shaking now a thousand emotions and replies running through their mind. All to try and hide from the truth that Muse buried in the darkest place of their heart. To hear it now would be death. ""You want to change, Muse. She does not. So long as it remains this way, there is nothing you can do. So long as you remain, it will crush you."" Muse stilled, knowing, understanding. A truth, an impossible one. 

As Muses eyes opened to survey the world around them. The virus bomb begining to give way as their body regenerated. She herself was reconstitutiting her own form, a bitter look on her face. From where she left a massive dreadnought. The finally dead form of Rylanor. Muse clenched their fist walking over to it as Fulgrim spit curses behind them. Raising their hand to the nameplate Muse try to convey everything they now felt. Regret, sadness, disappointment, reconciliation, understanding. ""Back to the ship Muse, we're leaving this forsaken rock."" Fulgrim called but received no answer. ""MUSE?!"" Their was a clattering by her foot. She lowered herself to retrieve it. An icon of the 3rd legion freshly ripped from cloth. She turned immediately to see Muse staring at her with a solemn expression. Worry worked its way through her bones. ""Muse what are doing, this is no time for one of your little rebellious rebukes."" Their was no response. ""MUSE, I said we're leaving."" Through the virus bomb and smoke Fulgrim could make out the shadow of muse. 

""No."" Muse replied. ""What?!"" Fulgrim asked, something was wrong the denial of Rylanor had already shaken her, something was about to happen. ""No more butchering."" ""What are you talking about? You're a warrior, remember?!"" ""I'm not a warrior,¬†I'm a monster...¬†Like you."" Even as they spoke with all the pride and gut they could muster, every word hurt. Fulgrim approached tentatively now, a pleading tone begining to leak out. ""Muse, we're... partners. Survivors. We¬†need¬†each other. Wh-what about our purpose? Our reward?! Becoming the bounty of Slaanesh."" Muses words were calmer now. If they didn't say it now they never would. ""I'm not doing this for the reward. I'm not doing this because someone told me to.¬†I'm doing this for¬†me. For millennia I waited, for millennia I stood by you, stood with you, for millennia I've loved you just to hate myself, and I can't do that anymore."" 

Fulgrims vision twisted her hand came up to the hilt of her sword gripping it tight. ""So what are you going to say after all these years you no longer love me?!?!"" Muse looked at Fulgrim in genuine disapointment when they replied. ""I guess you dont understand me anymore, Ill never say I dont love you."" Fulgrim was upon Muse in a moment sword raised, veins pulsed on face, her eyes flared with daemonic rage. As she swung down she was in disbelief at the sight. Muse had seen the attack coming. Watched her for over a thousand years, knew the feeling she had. The same Muse felt when Fulgrim fell. They had summoned up all their own daemonic strength to counter fulgrim more than that however, fulgrim froze at the sword which blazed to life in front of her, one once given by her gorgon sister. She hadn't even noticed Muse had been carrying it for years. Fulgrims voiced roared in the clash,""I never gave you that?!?!"" 

""No you didn't, I kept it to remember an old friend whom you murdered."" Rylanor, Ferra,Muse all those she loved appeared to Fulgrim in her manic rage, as she lashed out at Muse their face was blended between shock and incredulity. Striking again and again but far too disturbed to aim properly. ""YOU CANT LEAVE, YOU DONT GET TO LEAVE US!!!!YOU HAVE TO STAY WITH ME. YOU ARE MINE MUSE!!!!!MINE!!!!!!!"" In that moment she struck out and tried to take Muses head. If they did they'd have fallen into the Warp. Back to Slaanesh, back to her. 

She missed and her attack did nothing bit split the air. Somehow she lost sight of Muse. She glanced back and forth used her inhuman speeds to fly to every corner of area. Yet still she couldn't find Muse. She did this again and again, all to end up back at the dreadnought of Rylanor. ""This was you!"" Her voice was low and full of venom.""It was you!"" She struck the dreadnought rending it apart. But for the thousands of pieces it was now, it didn't seem like enough to Fulgrim. Rage swallowed her in that moment as she struck the sarcophagus over and over again. Even after grinding the dreadnought to dust Fulgrim was left heaving so hard it was closer to hyperventilation.Tears began to pour down her face mixed with deranged laughter. ""My Muse would never leave. My Muse couldn't leave me. My Muse Will Never...leave...mee."" in the aftermath of it all, a strained roar could be heard echoing across the world. A wail so loud it could quiet thunder.

Magisters steps were drowned out by the following Imperial fists. ""This was a joke"" magister thought to themselves, ""a stupid sick joke."" Fears, hopes, old grudges all manifested the moment the door opened. In the center of a pure white cylindrical chamber lined with any symbol or reliquiry of divine ordinance that could be gathered. 10 librarians lined the walls, weapons at the ready at a moments notice. In the rooms center was a tall black scaled lizard like daemon hanging and impaled by multiple silver, golden, brass chains etched with runes and holy scripture. Several devices sat at their legs wires attaching and injecting sleep inducing chemicals to keep them calm, poisonous chemicals to keep them weak. 12 psykers sat in a ring around the daemon further pressing against the malevolent auras it might exude, as well as battering the creature to further weaken it. 

Magister internally cursed who ever was in charge of security. So many flaws on the way here, this didn't feel like it was enough. Though maybe that was the punchline. Magister let out a sigh of annoyance then stepped within the chamber all roiling rage and rancor. They approached the daemon and set a seat down in front of them. The librarians readied weapons in disbelief at Magisters audacity. Any protocol they would have had was shattered. ""So are you just going sit there or did you come here to say something, Muse?"" Magister spoke, as they did the daemon slowly opened their eyes. Each of the librarians weapons rose and ignited with power while the chants of the psykers increased. Magister crossed their right leg over their left watching the visible struggle Muse was enduring to continue standing. ""So what is it that you've come to say."" Magister words were full sarcasm and irritation. ""I've come to make things right."" Muses reply was simple and despite the alien face Magister could detect no lie, though disbelief was evident. 

""We'll then, I see no point for this conversation, if you've come to make things right then I can drop you into a sun if like."" Magister stood and made their way to leave before Muses voice raised into a yell, ""NNNOOO!"" Each of the librarians stepped closer about to strike before magister raised their hand. The astartes settled back into their positions. ""Then why are you here?"" Magister questioned. ""I'm here to make things right, to make up for everything I was complacent in. For everything I did, with my own hands."" Muse tried to speak with sincere a voice as they could. Magister unimpressed stepped forward drawing their chainsword pressing it against the daemons chest. ""You think someone like you has a right to any kind of redemption except in fire. You could have walked away at any time from that viper yet you-."" Muses fist tightened and chains shook as they did. As much as Muse wished they could throw away feeling they had for millennia, that would be impossible, apart of them wanted to strike magister with all their might for the insult but they slackened and calmed. 

A noticeable difference that caught Magister by suprise, the offense intentional. One Magister would never let slide. They sheathed their sword returning to their seat. ""Even were such a thing feasible or even possible, no in the imperium would accept a traitor like you."" Magister explained. ""True enough, much of the strength granted to me by slaanesh is gone, I've severed my ties with the Emperor's Children."" Muse voice caught in their throat."" I've stepped away from Fulgrim... Forever."" Magister met their pitiful gaze with a stern one. ""Fine."" Every head in the chamber shifted their gaze to Magister, though many of their faces were hidden or masked their was an obvious worry that they might be controlled. "" But make no mistake, any move you make, you make by my say so, if you so much as breath without me allowing you. I will send you back to your primarch in pieces. One mistep, one wrong move,"" Magister stood once again sword drawn, blades spinning. Magister raised their arm bringing it down in a diagnol slash across their chest. More than enough strength to draw blood and more than enough to split the flesh beneath. ""And I will send you back to your primarch in pieces. Never forget what you are and what you've done."" 

The cut was deep, Muse considered whether Magister had tried to kill them with that hit, but Muse met Magisters eye and nodded their head. They stared at eachother for a long moment. Muse begging with their eyes, of the many they could have tried to reach out to, Magister would be the most fair and neutral even given their history. In some part of their being they hoped Magister would kill them if only to grant a bit of release from this existence that Muse didn't deserve. Whether intentionally or not Magister saw that and hated, it hated them. Too many friends and astartes were dead to let them walk away from it all. ""Very well Muse, but I dictate the terms of your sentence."" Magister sheathed their sword again turning their back and returning to the entrance. ""I'll let you know what I come up with. So I suggest you stay quiet as a mouse until I return."" Muse closed their eyes and lowered their head at that. Muse stepped away with thousands of cuts and bruises from their encounter with Fulgrim. They didn't feel a single one. As they stumbled away in a fugue state they still felt as if their entirety was being strangled. Whatever magister coulde bring to bare it couldnt amount to that. As Magister stepped from the room their was no end to the objections, Magister pulled a cigar from their coat, lighting it and taking a long overdue drag from it. A reunion of the most unlikely kind ""Get me Inquisitor Slickback.""

They‚Äôre 4 months old, litter trained, dewormed and vaccinated.

Ash and Caramel have been inseparable since they were born. They are the most adorable pair who sleep, eat and play together.
They are shy with strangers so they require a family thats patient and understanding of their nature. Once given ample time, they‚Äôll adjust to new surroundings and people very well and show their true colors- friendly and VERY playful. Adopting them would mean 24/7 entertainment.

It was about Katy ‚Äústealing‚Äù Taylor‚Äôs backup dancers. As if there aren‚Äôt a million other talented dancers who could‚Äôve easily taken their place. Taylor is also the capitalist queen so I don‚Äôt know why she was so personally offended over a business deal. 

The Kendrick Lamar rap‚Ä¶ good god. Taylor and Kendrick should never be on the same song. It‚Äôs like oil and water. She‚Äôs not edgy and there is nothing wrong with that. Dolly Parton isn‚Äôt edgy. Gwen Stefani isn‚Äôt edgy. You don‚Äôt have to be edgy to be a good pop star. The fact that she wants to come off as ‚Äútough‚Äù so bad is odd. 

I remember thinking it was so cool how the music video had so many cameos but now I just find it kind of‚Ä¶ gimmicky? Madonna did the same for her Bitch I‚Äôm Madonna video, Maroon 5 did it for the Girls Like You video. I think it just looks a little desperate.

Grew up in upstate New York and the Chicago suburbs. Spent part of my youth metro Detroit, Michigan.  Sister went to school in RI.  Recently went back to RI with her and after visiting 42 of the 50 states, I have to call RI my favorite.  

1.  Food is excellent everywhere.  Too many good restaurants to name.   Coffee is superior to anything I've had in any major metro hub.  Providence being a culinary hotbed certainly has something to do with it.  
  
2.  RI in the fall is the best.   Taking Route 6 west into the smaller cities was the most relaxed I've felt in years.  Epic views.  
  
3.  I love that in one single day I can make day trips to the beach and the bigger cities and not feel taxed.  I can cover the entire state and do it all over the next day if I feel like it.     
  
4.  Speaking of the beach, walking Misquamicut State Beach as the sun dropped is probably one of the most beautiful moments of my entire life.

5.  Ivy League.  Seeing a Brown football game in that beautiful old stadium beats many of the experiences I've had going to major college football games where attendance for a single game is 80K plus.   Something about the tradition of that program just makes you love the sport even more, especially when college football just seems so corrupt.   We spoke to a few undergrads while there as my sister is a Brown alum and they are just so grounded and polite.  

6.  Providence is the most underrated city I've ever visited.   I can't recommend it enough.

7.  There is nothing more to say about Newport/Block Island that hasn't already been said.  Just mind blowing any way that you look at it.

Hope I didn't annoy anyone here, but I'm just very envious of those who get to live and work here.   I love Rhode Island.

Bat bug or bed bug?,679,1g3y8v7,whatsthisbug,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g3y8v7,53,1728961687.0,"Hey, long time lurker, first time poster. Guess it‚Äôs time for me to make the obligatory ‚Äúis this a bed bug post‚Äù

So my sister found this bug on her toilet seat at like 9:30 pm after spending the day out of the home. 

Like most of you, my first thought was bed bug, but in desperation I got some pics of this guy with our microscope too. Seems like a pretty hairy boi.

In the microscope pics, you can see pretty long hairs along its pronotum. Is my ID of a bat bug correct or am I just coping? 

For context we live in rural Pennsylvania in an area with a lot of bats. We have had them roosting in our shutters before, so it wouldn‚Äôt be super unusual to have them in our attic. We do have confirmed mice as well and I‚Äôm just kind of hoping it hitchhiked on one of those boys."

I am debt-free.
I have no liabilities.
I don't have dependent parents.
I have a parental house to fall back on.
I don't have to sleep hungry.

The internet is a scary place and it constantly tries to always sell you the idea that 'you don't have enough'.

Your lifestyle isn't enough.
The old brand of iPhone isn't enough.
The 2bhk you are living in isn't enough.
The car you are driving isn't enough.

We tend to be in the mad rush of chasing money, build passive incomes, and striving for the desired FIRE number because our aspirations are constantly being toyed with.

Stop for a moment and ask yourself:

- What is it that you actually need to sustain?
- How much money do you really need to live a happy life?
- What will happen if you stop living in your dream city for a few years?
- What will happen if you don't put your children in the costliest school?

Capitalism instills fear.
It makes you constantly question what you have. And to never be content.

I was once told that people don't care about the journey of an average individual from point A to B, they are interested in knowing how they reached Z dramatically.¬†Spikes matter, and sudden growth matters.

On the contrary, I believe every step on the ladder matters.

Every achievement should be celebrated!

Every new experience adds to who you are as a person and is not an isolated event that allows you to jump a few blocks to reach the top.

So, I might have a car someday, just not when the ecosystem wants/forces me to!"

For context, I‚Äôm a Republican who has never voted for Donald Trump and never will. No matter your political affiliation, if you‚Äôre a student loan borrower or care about those who are, this issue affects you.

When I received my golden letter from MOHELA under the Biden-Harris administration, telling me that my student loans were forgiven, I felt an incredible sense of relief. For a brief moment, I thought I didn‚Äôt care who won the next election. I was wrong.

Under Trump, PSLF is at risk. There‚Äôs a real possibility that forgiven debts could be reinstated, or that future borrowers may never see the relief they‚Äôve worked so hard for. This isn‚Äôt just a political debate‚Äîthis is about real people‚Äôs lives, futures, and financial security.

I want to urge everyone, regardless of party lines, to consider the impact of policies on student loan forgiveness. Please have some mercy for your fellow borrowers. Vote BLUE down the ticket to protect PSLF and help others achieve the same relief that‚Äôs given me peace of mind after years of debt.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

As based on the¬†[Constitution](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-iii/clauses/39#:~:text=Treason%20against%20the%20United%20States,on%20Confession%20in%20open%20Court.)¬†and the interpretation of founding father and Chief Justice,¬†[John Marshall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall):

‚ÄúThe Constitution specifically identifies what constitutes treason against the United States and, importantly, limits the offense of treason to only two types of conduct:¬†**(1) ‚Äúlevying war‚Äù against the United States**; or (2) ‚Äúadhering to \[the\] enemies \[of the United States\], giving them aid and comfort. Although there have not been many treason prosecutions in American history‚Äîindeed, only one person has been indicted for treason since 1954‚Äîthe Supreme Court has had occasion to further define what each type of treason entails.

The offense of ‚Äú**levying war**‚Äù against the United States was interpreted narrowly in Ex parte Bollman & Swarthout (1807), a case stemming from the infamous alleged plot led by former Vice President Aaron Burr to overthrow the American government in New Orleans.

The Supreme Court dismissed charges of treason that had been brought against two of Burr‚Äôs associates‚ÄîBollman and Swarthout‚Äîon the grounds that their alleged conduct did not constitute levying war against the United States within the meaning of the Treason Clause. It was not enough, Chief Justice John Marshall opinion emphasized, merely to conspire ‚Äúto subvert by force the government of our country‚Äù by recruiting troops, procuring maps, and drawing up plans.

**Conspiring to levy war was distinct from actually levying war.**¬†Rather, a person could be convicted of treason for levying war only if there was an ‚Äú**actual assemblage of men for the purpose of executing a treasonable design.**‚Äù In so holding, the Court sharply confined the scope of the offense of treason by levying war against the United States.‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

‚Äú[Penalty:](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason_laws_in_the_United_States#:~:text=Penalty%3A%20Under%20U.S.%20Code%20Title,office%20in%20the%20United%20States.)¬†Under U.S. Code Title 18, the penalty is death, or not less than five years‚Äô imprisonment (with a minimum fine of $10,000, if not sentenced to death).

Any person convicted of treason against the United States also forfeits the right to hold public office in the United States.‚Äù"

That's it. Admittedly, the draws could have been luckier but it's still a shame that we haven't got to see a lot of NA vs EU this year.

Because of that, I think it would be really cool to have a western LoL tournament. Maybe the Top 3 seeds of NA and EU and the top 1/2 seed of CBLOL and LLA. Put them into a gauntlet like in LPL Playoffs and let's go. I think this would be hype af. Think of all the drama, banter and content. You can also make cross-team content much easier, because most of the players can speak english. Also I think that it would be a great motivation for players of all participating regions, because this would feel like a balanced tournament where everything can happen and that you can actually win. Against LPL/LCk there is always a lot of copium involved, but winning against NA in front of an EU crowd or winning against EU in front of an NA crowd is still a great experience that could fuel the motivation for all western regions and also bring us closer together."

I went to check my credit and it was there. All sorts of 30 day late payments and 2 60 day late payments, including for September. My question is what do I do from here.

OverviewThe final part of our 60 day commitment is here!  
This patch marks the last set of changes we aimed to implement for the 60 day community commitment while also addressing issues we previously didn‚Äôt have time to fix.  
  
So what does this patch contain?  
We have made changes to the remaining weapons and stratagems we weren't able to finish for the patch on September 17th, ensuring they‚Äôre now more interesting and effective. We have also dedicated some time and we‚Äôve looked over some key core systems like enemy spawning as well as targeting and vision for the Automatons. Based on your feedback, we‚Äôve fine-tuned the Automaton experience to hopefully make them feel less frustrating to play against. Additionally, we have also adjusted the Helldivers durability to make your armor choices feel more impactful.  
  
Finally, we've introduced new functionality to certain items to give players more depth in mastering their equipment. For example, the GR-8 Recoilless Rifle and the AC-8 Autocannon now have programmable ammunition, and drones that come with backpacks can be toggled on or off for added control.  
  
We hope you enjoy these changes! The team at Arrowhead has been thrilled to work on this 60-day commitment for you, our community and players and seeing your reactions to the work we‚Äôve done! Together, we aim to ensure Helldivers 2 delivers on its core fantasy and remains a game we all love to play.  
  
BalancingGeneral changes  
Additional Supply Items are now visible on the minimap  


* Exosuits 
* Support Stratagems 

Removed ricochets from Orbital Stratagem projectiles, Eagle-1 bombs and FAF-14 Spear missiles  


* They can no longer ricochet off of targets 

Helldiver armor tweaks, both Heavy and Light armor are now more effective  
  
Heavy armor reduces damage taken by 25%, up from 20%  


* 5% more damage reduction 

Light armor increases damage taken by 25%, down from 33%  


* 8% less damage taken 

Stratagems and Weapon tag description updates, they now show more information and are also categorized  


* Armor penetration 2 is classified as Light armor penetrating 
* Armor penetration 3 is classified as Medium armor penetrating 
* Armor penetration 4 is classified as Heavy armor penetrating 
* Armor penetration 5+ is classified as Anti tank 

Primary Weapons  
Plasma projectile behavior  


* We‚Äôve standardized the behavior of Plasma projectiles, which previously had varying characteristics in how they traveled through the air. Now, all Plasma projectiles experience high drag, causing them to slow down faster. However, each plasma weapon still fires projectiles at different speeds and calibers, so their effective ranges will remain distinct. For most weapons, this change won‚Äôt be very noticeable 
* With the SG-8P Punisher Plasma you‚Äôll see a less pronounced arc in its projectile path. Instead, it will start off faster and lose speed more rapidly, keeping its effective range about the same 

PLAS-101 Purifier  
Projectiles can now be charged up with a damage multiplier that scales  


* Minimum charge of 0.1 sec gives a 50% damage multiplier 
* Maximum charge of 1 sec gives a 100% damage multiplier 
* Maximum charge projectile damage increased from 100 to 200 
* Maximum charge projectile durable damage increased from 50 to 100 
* Maximum charge explosion damage increased from 150 to 300 
* The explosion doesn‚Äôt scale, but a fully charged shot has a different explosion effect: 
* Minimum charge (0.1‚Äì0.99 sec): Inner radius 1m, outer radius 2m, explosion damage 75 
* Maximum charge (1 sec): Inner radius 2.9m, outer radius 3m, explosion damage 300

Stratagem Support Weapons  
AC-8 Autocannon  
New weapon function: Programmable ammunition now allows you to switch between normal and and flak projectiles  


* Flak projectiles are proximity triggered shrapnel explosions with a larger explosion radius 

GR-8 Recoilless Rifle

   * Explosion damage increased from 250 to 350 
*  
* Orbital Airburst Strike
*  
   * Salvoes increased from 3 to 4 
   * Duration between salvoes increased from 3 to 4 sec 
*  
* A/MG-43 Machine Gun Sentry
*  
   * Magazine capacity increased from 125 to 175 
   * Cooldown reduced from 120 to 90 sec 
   * Life time reduced from 180 to 150 sec 
*

*  
* A/AC-8 Autocannon Sentry
*  
   * Cooldown reduced from 180 to 150 sec 
   * Life time reduced from 180 to 150 sec 
*  
* MD-17 Anti Tank Mines
*  
* We are working on changes to the Anti-Personnel and Incendiary Mines, however we are not yet happy with the fixes, as we feel they introduced too many new problems. We will continue working on these changes and include them in a future patch
*

   * Damage increased from 800 to 2000 
   * Explosion radius decreased 
*

   * Cooldown reduced from 150 to 120 sec 
   * Lifetime reduced from 180 to 150 sec 
*  
* FX-12 Shield Generator Relay
*  
   * Removed charge delay between damage taken 
   * Increased charge rate from 300 to 400 health/sec 
   * Radius increased from 8 to 15m 
   * Once the shield is down, it will no longer regenerate 
*  
* Gameplay
* Patrol Spawning
*  
   * Previously, once the mission was completed but before extraction, we significantly increased patrol spawns across the entire map. Now,¬†the increased patrol spawns are concentrated around the extraction site, with more patrols appearing the closer you are to it. This change should make patrol spawning feel more logical and reduce the penalty for players who complete the mission but still want to explore the map or collect samples. Please let us know if you still experience issues with the patrol spawning! 
*  
* Terminids
*  
* Bile Spewers
*  
   * Legs health reduced from 300 to 200 
*  
* Nursing Spewers
*  
   * Legs health reduced from 300 to 200 
*  
* Hunters
*  
   * Have a short shared area cooldown for their pounce ability 
   * Can now totally blow up if affected with enough damage 
*  
* Scavengers
*  
   * Can blow up if affected with enough damage 
*  
* Automatons
*  
* Automaton Targeting
*  
   * Some enemies were able to shoot at you without needing proper line of sight, which caused them to fire into or through walls, track you even when hidden, and ignore smoke effects. We've addressed these issues, so now you should be able to use stealth more effectively against the Automatons, and they won‚Äôt be able to shoot through walls or see you when they shouldn‚Äôt. Please let us know if you still encounter issues like these! 
*  
* Automaton projectiles
*  
   * Normal small projectiles damage reduced from 40 to 35, used by enemies like the Devastators, Emplacements and Conscripts 
   * Heavy projectiles damage reduced from 65 to 60, used by enemies like the Heavy Emplacements and Scout Striders 
*  
* Hulk Bruiser
*  
   * In response to their disapproval of a newly installed cannon on the Automaton Hulk Bruisers, Super Earth High Command sent a crack commando to sabotage their production facilities. The skilled operative promptly escaped into the shadows after completing their mission. Today, still wanted by the Automatons, they survive as a soldier of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can enlist‚Ä¶ John Helldiver 
   * As a result the Automatons had to revert back to using rocket launchers for their Hulk Bruisers 
*  
* All Devastators
*  
   * Head armor decreased from 2 to 1 
   * Head health increased from 100 to 110 
*  
* Berserkers
*  
   * Head health decreased from 125 to 110 
*  
* Heavy Devastator
*  
   * The pause between their salvoes has been slightly increased, providing Helldivers with a better opportunity to counterattack 
*  
* All Tanks
*  
   * Front armor reduced from 6 to 5, our previous tweak didn't have the intended effect on gameplay that we expected so we‚Äôve reverted this back 
   * The rear weak spots of the Tank's body now have their own health pool, which matches the Tank's previous total health. Once this health pool is depleted, the Tank will be destroyed. Additionally, these weak spots also deal 150% damage to the Tank's main health 
*  
* Annihilator Tank Turrets & Shredder Tank Turrets
*  
   * The rear weak spots of the Tank's body now have their own health pool, which matches the Tank's previous total health. Once this health pool is depleted, the Tank will be destroyed. Additionally, these weak spots also deal 200% damage to the Tank's main health 
*  
* Barrager Tank Turret
*  
   * The Turret is now destroyed if the Tank body is destroyed 
*  
* Fixes
* Resolved Top Priority issues:
*  
   * Not enough enemies spawn to complete Eradicate missions 
   * Some enemies were able to shoot at you without needing proper line of sight, which caused them to fire into or through walls, track you even when hidden, and ignore smoke effects 
   * Patrol Spawning should now feel more logical and reduce the penalty for players who complete the mission but still want to explore the map or collect samples

* Medium Priority:
*  
   * Players are unable to shoot properly while in the air using a jetpack 
   * Stratagem balls bounce unpredictably off cliffs and some spots 
   * Some Eagle Stratagems may not drop when deployed on a swamp planet 
   * Reinforcement may not be available for players who join a game in progress 
   * Pelican-1 may sometimes be launched away if hit with an impaler tentacle 
   * Supply packs may be incorrectly used if pressing down on a controller while calling in a stratagem

This is a test run: If all goes well, we'd like to keep posts like these coming for select balance changes in the future.¬†

Important: The changes we are about to share are not yet confirmed to happen. It is possible this design will be altered before appearing in the game or even be scrapped entirely. We ask that you please manage your expectations if they are not implemented into the game, and to expect it to take some time for these changes to be implemented if we decide to move forward.¬†These changes would be tentatively planned for early next year.

The Trickster¬†

Reverting to previous version:¬†

* Revert base movement speed to 4.4 m/s (was 4.6 m/s)¬†
* Revert Terror Radius to 24 m (was 32 m)¬†
* Revert Laceration Meter to 6 (was 8)¬†
* Revert time between throws to 0.33 (was 0.3)¬†
* Revert Throw Rate multiplier for Main Event to 1.667‚ÄØ(was 1.33)¬†
* Revert Main Event requirement to 30 (was 8)¬†
* Revert Main Event activation window to 30 (was 24)¬†
* Re-instate per-throw modifiers (Throw Rate + Movement speed while throwing)¬†
* Revert addons:¬†
* Fizz-Spin Soda¬†
* Ji-Woon's Autograph¬†

Then some adjustments:‚ÄØ¬†

* Increase Laceration decay delay to 12 seconds (was 10)¬†
* Move Fizz-Spin Soda's current effect to Memento Blades¬†

Dev notes: The previous changes to The Trickster were contentious, with many Trickster players preferring the previous version. We'd like to explore the possibility of reverting the bulk of these tweaks while keeping the quality-of-life improvements (such as the removal of recoil).¬†"

20 Years of Anand Movie,186,1g43rqy,tollywood,https://i.redd.it/57a1amaz3wud1.png,43,1728984963.0,"If there's one movie I love wholeheartedly from TFI it's Anand Movie. This is a classic and a quintessential Tollywood movie. It was released exactly today, 20 years ago. 

The movie is like a warm cup of coffee on a beautiful monsoon morning. It has an insane re-watch value. Starting with the set design, costumes, cinematography, music, props, the dialogues, every single thing about the movie elevates the beautiful story it tells. 

The movie feels like a love letter to young Telugu women, crafted with utmost respect, dignity and affection. 

The characters of Roopa and Anand are very well written. Roopa, her trauma, her relationships and friendship dynamics, her strength, her mindset was portrayed very well by Kamalini Mukherjee. Raja was wonderful in bringing the gentle and earnest Anand to life. Can't imagine anyone else in these roles although Anand's role was apparently written with Pawan Kalyan in mind. 

Anand's music album is one that never tires you, KM Radha Krishnan has cemented the movie as a classic with his compositions. 

The lyrics penned by Veturi have breathed life into the movie. Every single line is so beautiful that it brings tears to my eyes. 

Satya Krishnan, Anish Kuruvilla, Anuj Guruwara, Chandana Chakrabarti, Bakhitha, Snoopy gaadu, Bhow Bhow Gaadu, uff, the movie wouldn't be the same without this wonderful cast. 

Inka raayali ante oka 20 pages rastha. Antha picchi ga istam naaku ee movie. 

There's a directors cut of this movie on YouTube with some extra scenes. That shows a bit more of Roopa falling in love with Anand. Do check it out of you have time. It's totally worth it.

I'm really sad that there's no re-release of this movie today, but I hope it can be done sometime in future. I'll bring at least 20 people to the theater lol.

He had a weight check on Saturday and is now 42.8 pounds, up from just under 35 when we got him.  He's way more mobile and his personality (and stubbornness) is really coming out.  He likes to go for short walks up the road and is now sleeping for 6 hours before needing to go potty.  He still has trouble pooping and it has been tough finding the right amount of laxative to give him to help soften the stool but not give him diarrhea.  We need him to still gain about 7 pounds before the vet will feel comfortable with doing the neuter and hopefully that will help shrink his prostate.  We'll also have more blood work done to see if he's leveled out there as well.  He is definitely a work in progress and now maybe only a warm mess but we live him anyway."

She had blond hair as a toddler but it darkened by the time she was 4. 


Why is she so insistent on something that clearly is not the case? She does not dye it so it is not a matter of her trying to pass bleached hair as natural "

Here's the final update on my post which plenty people asked for. These were my previous posts:

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/s/5wWLEszRnz


Update One: https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/s/4OacmL825W

After I said my father that I am not going to be a part of his scheme, he kicked me out the house, he went to my room and threw away all my clothes and suitcases out the window and kicked me out. I was thinking of going to my friend's place and then figure out stuff from there; but my father came out after 30 minutes or so and then told me to come back in. Then he said multiple things like I'm not good son and I won't get anywhere in life following laws and all. He took my phone away and locked it in his office for one week(I got the phone back on sunday).

Next morning he started saying stuff like I'm the biggest loser to ever exist as I didn't agree to join in his scheme, said that true children are those who takes all the blame of parents mistake on their own shoulders.

Honestly, I don't understand how can this person think of doing a scheme like this and then gaslight me saying I'm the one who is bad.

That's that.

And, 


-I'm no more enrolled in any fake job.


-The fake salary is returned back by the bank to the guy who paid it.


-CIFAS protection is on, so that nobody can open accounts in my name and I have also locked my credit.


I am going to start university soon, so I'm moving to my grandparents place abroad, so I'll close my bank account as I don't need it, as maybe my parents might try to do something like this if my account is open.

Thank you so much to all of you for your help. Words cannot describe my gratitude. Thank you so very much."

Like Swedish women's folk/peasant dresses, Lederhosen, Caucasian chokha, the kilt, etc. for Europe and the previous examples for East Asia. With only a handful of exceptions that I'm aware of almost all European folk dress seems to be from the lower classes whereas folk dress in East and Southeast Asia seems to come from various social classes, if anything favoring the historical upper strata of those societies.

Am I mistaken? If not, why the European pattern? My impression is the one found in East and Southeast Asia is closer to the worldwide one.

So I suppose you can call this a transformation.. I‚Äôve never done anything like this online so it‚Äôll probably come across clumsy and awkward lol..  I‚Äôd like to preface this by saying this isn‚Äôt a cry for attention, a sob story poor me (despite the sonny aspects), or a humble brag type thing, as I know how douchey this stuff can come across to those who might not be crazy passionate about sports.. I‚Äôm posting this purely as a ‚Äúif I can not only survive that shit, but come out of it stronger and focused on something, then you can. Anyone can‚Äù. I just feel like sharing some of my story so that it might inspire or comfort those in similar situations with similar experiences, 

a year and 3 month,  difference age 31 vs 32.. I went from 62kg/136lbs to 90kg/198lbs relatively lean‚Ä¶ but before all of that, I was in absolute pit of depression, totally hopeless, filled with hate for everyone and everything, I was a hairs breadth away from committing suicide, I very nearly did..  my mental health has never really been spectacular, still isn‚Äôt, but this was a particularly bad time after dealing with a lot of trauma and pain on top of already being a mess, I had experienced a serious heartbreak and spent years wallowing in it, stewing in it, just sorta waiting around to die.. life was falling apart.. But in may last year the shitty lifestyle really caught up with me, (your 30‚Äôs will humble you quick).. and I felt like my body was on the verge of shutting down. Family and friends were deeply concerned but as always in these situations, they could t force me to change. It had to start with me.. So 1st of may 2023 I decided I‚Äôm done with feeling shit, I‚Äôm taking charge and making the change. Because if I didn‚Äôt, I wouldn‚Äôt be alive for much longer. 

I got clean of some nasty habits, clean of addiction, changed my entire diet and went full vegetarian and stuck to a consistent meal plan, did whatever I could for my health, got a new job, started saving money along with investing in myself, reading more, sleeping better, joined a gym, started gaining weight and then discovered powerlifting and arm wrestling. I fell in love with those sports and the communities within them, met lots of wonderful people and have a circle of encouragement around me. The passion I have for this healthy living shit literally saved my life and I‚Äôll never go back.. Getting jacked is what ‚Äúgetting shit together‚Äù looked like for me, hard training was my calling..but it might not be like that for everyone. It could be music, art, cooking, volunteering, any other sport, reading, writing.. whatever tickles your pickle! This just happens to be what works for me

I‚Äôm not gonna patronise you, dear internet stranger, and try spout some holier than thou bs or that I‚Äôm the epitome of maturity and inspiration or health, because I still feel shity. I still have my bad days. I still fall into dark places. life is still a mess and I still slack in many areas.. I still struggle with my mental health, I‚Äôm still crippled with loneliness, anxiety, deep trauma, not much hope for the future, I still have no fucking idea how I‚Äôm gonna make it in this world.. But you know what?.. That‚Äôs ok. No one is perfect. Life is crazy..  I‚Äôm certainly not gonna make myself feel shit for slipping up, not knowing what to do in this world, and I‚Äôm certainly not gonna make myself feel bad for feeling bad. I‚Äôm human. As are you. In my opinion and experience, getting out of a dark pit starts with being kind to yourself, forgiving yourself, offering yourself the same compassion and love you do for those around you. We push onwards, strive to become better versions of ourselves, be more caring and compassionate, get our minds, bodies and souls healthy üí™

I know exactly what it feels like to have no one, to be alone while dealing with utter despair, and I wouldn‚Äôt wish that on anyone, even total strangers on the other side of the world. 

I mean it when I say this, if there is any fellow internet stranger here that made it this far, that wants to talk, if you‚Äôre in a bad place, a good place, a weird place, need diet or training tips, help with addiction, or just want to chit chat, my DM‚Äôs are open.

I hope we can all show and receive a bit more love and compassion, and hopefully we can all pass it along to the next person.  

Peace.‚ù§Ô∏è"

It didn‚Äôt even have dial up Internet and I just use it to play pinball and play around on Microsoft Word and Excel and play a few games that came with the computer. I eventually started buying a computer magazine because it came with a free CD that had trial versions of various games including the first GTA and FIFA 98 I will play those free trials over and over again.

In late 98, while I was trying to install a game on my computer via floppy disk, my dad came and accidentally left his expired debit card on the computer table I was sitting at. I had taken out the floppy desk and kept it on top of the debit card and the little while later 12 year old me picked up both the floppy disk and the debit card as half of each was hanging off the table and stuck it into the floppy drive. The game didn‚Äôt load and I tried to eject the floppy disc from the drive but it was jammed. It‚Äôs then there occurred to me that I had stuck the debit card along with the floppy disk into the Drive. 

12 year-old had no idea about the internal components of a computer and I was terrified. My dad didn‚Äôt come back for the debit card so I was in the clear for that. For the next six months I told my parents that there was something wrong with my computer and whereas I had used the computer at least 2 to 3 hours a day prior to this screw up, I used it less than half an hour a day after that. Early 1999 my mom started asking me why I‚Äôm using the computer less than before. I was terrified and blurted out that there was a floppy stuck in the drive. She told my dad and he took it to the store. I was really terrified as to what would happen when the truth came out.

When he came back he said that the computer technician took the computer into his workshop and came out a few minutes later and asked him if he had any small children and he replied that he had a 12-year-old son. üòñ. Everyone of my friends at this point had their own computer and we would spend hours talking about the free games that came with our computers and my parents would constantly blackmail me by threatening to tell my friends of my screwup if I didn‚Äôt do my chores. 

I am much older now but it is still one of the most embarrassing things that has ever happened to me. "

They don‚Äôt all end up perfect. ,1090,1g3u0af,smoking,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g3u0af,91,1728948776.0,"They don‚Äôt all end up perfect-learning each round. Learned what I did wrong and what I did right and thought it might help some folks. And I found a few of my favorite things. 

What I did wrong:

-I tried the hot and fast method to shave some time. Not saying it doesn‚Äôt work-but I‚Äôm not sure my cut had the fat in it for it and my temp probably spiked over 300 a few times. Definitely works for Boston Butt, but my flat came out dry on my choice brisket. I kinda knew this and I injected the night before but didn‚Äôt help much. 

-Added rub to bare spots 3-4 hours in. The grease was already cooking up, at that point the new seasoning just caked and didn‚Äôt stick. Shoulda have just rolled on to get the best bark. 

-Underestimated how much it would cook after removing it. The bigger the chunk, the more it‚Äôll keep cooking after you take it off. This was my biggest so far at 16 pounds I should have pulled it earlier. On the bigger ones, it might be worth starting to check in the 190‚Äôs. 

What I did right: Ôøº

-2.99/pound Kroger Brisket. Great deal. 

-Chupacabra Brisket Magic. My favorite seasoning hands down now. It‚Äôs perfect. 

-Mustard binder. I tried Olive Oil again on my last one, and it caked and didn‚Äôt stick near as good as the mustard. 

-Didn‚Äôt cry about it ü§£. Me and my wife made Brisket Chili which is literally the best I‚Äôve ever had and then burnt ends from the point. Got a few good slices and discovered some amazing recipes from the rest. I might dry out a brisket on purpose every now and then (I‚Äôm kidding ü§£ü§£). 

-Straight Hickory for the whole cook. I‚Äôm from Tennessee I just put this in there to start a fight in the comments. ü§£ü§£ü§£

The before pictures are early 2017 when I was my heaviest. That year is when I lost all of the initial weight and got down to about 195lbs. I maintained that pretty well until 2020, then I got into running and started taking testosterone which helped me get down to 185lbs, my lowest weight since high school. In late 2022, my now coach convinced me to start bodybuilding, did my first cycle, and eventually got on stage in late 2023, and that‚Äôs been my focus ever since.

On May 1st 2024 GME's volume was 2,653,200 and the daily average volume back then was around 3-4 million.

On May 13th GME's volume was 187,241,700 and increased to 206,979,100 on Tuesday 14th May, the day GME's price ran up to $80 in pre-market. Although the volume was lower on Wednesday 15th May, it was still a staggering 131,790,100.

I don't believe MSM's narrative of 'Roaring Kitty tweeted' as being the reason as much of the volume occurred in pre-market and afterhours when the vast majority of retail investors can't trade.

GME has no debt and $4.6 billion cash on hand and in my opinion anyone claiming that tHe ShOrTs ClOsEd are either shills or bad actors.

As for me, I just like the stock.

Reagan is one of the best female protagonists. CHANGE MY MIND.,650,1g3x2se,InsideJob,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g3x2se,34,1728958018.0,"Media in the past 20 or so years has been FANTASTIC for showing us a strong, independent woman taking the lead. But I feel like hollywood tends to lead towards having like the ""Elle Woods""- type front and center of this movement to try to show girls that ""women can be hot and powerful!"" and that became the kinda norm. Sure it empowers girls and all that, but I feel like this ""ideal image of girl power"" has caused a lot of non- ""conventionally attractive"" women to feel overlooked.

Reagan, however, is canonically mid-looking. She's not *ugly*, but she's not ""Elle Woods"" gorgeous. She's just completely normal. She doesn't have her shit together, she's not entirely confident, she's quirky and awkward and other than the genius intellect, very *real*. I feel like I can relate to her a lot (for these and other reasons), and I know a lot of other fans feel the same. Characters like Reagan are what could help to break this perfectionist standard that faces female protagonists. Even if the show never comes back, I hope more characters like Reagan start to pop up."

Rio wants Agatha DEAD. Not because they‚Äôre exes and enemies. It is because Rio wants Agatha to herself, fully, and they can only do that when she is dead (per Rio‚Äôs role as Lady Death). 

In rewatching the first episode, all the dialogue from Rio becomes clear with this new filter: none of her actions are malicious when viewed from her perspective. She is playful about killing Agatha because she wants them to be truly together. But Agatha would rather be powerful than with Rio, and this is what tore them apart (in addition to the possible Nicholas Scratch component).

Lines that hint at this past conflict in episode 1‚Äôs fight: 

-Rio is angry that Agatha chose the Dark-hold over her, making her immortal. Rio smiles when she makes Agatha bleed, saying, ‚ÄúAnd now - you‚Äôre vulnerable‚Äù (able to die) 

-The line ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt kill me, it‚Äôs not allowed‚Äù refers to the fact Lady Death cannot kill, only ferry souls, so Rio is frustrated she can‚Äôt force the issue. 

-Rio prefers her ‚Äúin a grave‚Äù - but Agatha insinuates she should prefer her when she‚Äôs powerful and formidable (their main conflict) 

-Finally, Agatha says Rio loves the ‚Äúanticipation‚Äù of Agatha‚Äôs death - because this is the ultimate consummation of their relationship. She‚Äôs waiting for their complete commitment to each other, that Agatha has been withholding. 

Even in episode 5, Rio salivates over the idea of ‚Äúslitting Agatha‚Äôs throat.‚Äù Again, not out of cruelty: but excitement and love that they can be together. "

THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF SEXUAL STYLE - SPONTANEOUS AND RESPONSIVE.

  
SPONTANEOUS - mauuna yung libog (sa isip muna) tapos saka susunod ang senses (erection, lubrication etc)

  
RESPONSIVE - kailangan muna istimulate ang senses (touching, kissing etc) bago susunod or maiisip ang libog



marami dito nagrereklamo pag partners nila e RESPONSIVE kasi they feel neglected kapag need muna nila mag initiate bago may mangyari. but let us remember that like love languages, may sex styles rin and iba iba tayo ng gusto and isa sya sa mga aspects ng compatibility. syempre ha iba yung issue kung may cheating or something similar. but in a healthy relationship, kasama to sa dapat natin iconsider. yun lang naman hehe try to learn your partners' patterns para eevrybody happy. yun lang ktnxbye!"

The bike has really transformed into something else giving the power and feedback like a triumph giving the classic feel of an RE . The bike produces 52HP and 59Nm compared to 40.90Hp and 50Nm on Dyno . While royal enfield claim 47 but on dyno it is somehwere between 42 43 . Thats 22% power increase . With the extra mods like better brakes , tyres and suspension . This is the bike RE should have launched . The bike feels on a whole new level and makes you want to keep it for a long time. i got my tank custom painted as i did not like black ray color on new model. 

Out of these here are my most liked mod

Quickshifter - feeling of it is something else compared to manual shifting but you need powertonic ecu to support it

Custom instrument cluster - inspired from triumph . The look of riding is top notch now

Custom paint job - the bike is a massive attention grabber and got people taking pictures as well . Made a lot a rider friends as well

High lift Camshaft - the bike pulls till the rev band and you can feel it pulling you . Definelty good

Suspension - expensive but transforms the handling and comfort to whole new level . 

All the mods are well worth and needs an explanation of its own . At the end the bike is perfect in all angles . Planning to do big bore if everything goes good in future . Thanks for readingüôÇ"

Took the left picture to send her my thanks.   Love my Mickey, hated seeing myself but accepted it as who I was always going to be.  This year she got me the matching Minnie.  This time took the right picture excited about the gift and double excited to see the changes a year has brought!  Started this May 1st with no hopes I would achieve any real results and have been blown away by all the positive changes! 47 down with 30 more to go to be the person I know I am inside and out. Not to mention giving me a real chance to be around for the long haul; happy, healthy and not a burden to my family."

Went to join the canal path and nearly crashed into a flash of a man who was leaving the canal running full pelt.

Didnt think much of it until I joined the canal path proper and a young woman was asking if I got a look at the guy as he had just  groped her.

It was pitch black and I honestly couldnt tell you any discernable features about the guy from the near crash incident. Other than I'd say he was below average height and I think possibly in running gear/gloves.

Poor woman was a bit shook up but alright. 

I went back on myself to see if I could catch a sight of the guy but to no avail, seemingly disappeared into the darkness of the early morning.

Please keep your wits about you around the canal folks, and if anyone comes across this utter scum bag conducting himself in a simelar manner please get him reported to the police.

The Chimera My Colleague Created Is Terrifyingly Human‚ÄîI Wish I Hadn't Seen It,97,1g45zrr,shortscarystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1g45zrr/the_chimera_my_colleague_created_is_terrifyingly/,15,1728993748.0,"We had argued months ago in his lab.

""Chimeras,"" I‚Äôd said, ""belong in fiction, not science. You cannot rewrite an organism‚Äôs Biology.""

He had disagreed. Fiercely. With a quiet conviction that unsettled me even then.

‚ÄúGenetically modifying a dog to speak?‚Äù I laughed.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just about speech,‚Äù he had said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about giving them speech, thought, adaptability‚Äîthe same adaptability we value in ourselves, while having them retain their original instincts and features.‚Äù

David always walked the line between genius and madness, but this... this was different.

He must‚Äôve finally crossed that line. Ever since his wife‚Äôs death last year, he‚Äôd been unhinged in a way only grief could explain.

The stress of being a single father for his daughter, Lily who was just 7, while also ensuring efficiency in his work must‚Äôve chipped away at his sanity. Atleast Lily has the family dog, Max, her ever-present guardian.

His invitation had been simple: *I‚Äôve done it. Come see.*

And in my curiosity‚Äîor perhaps arrogance‚ÄîI had to come.

The door creaked open. His home had always been messy‚Äîfilled with the warm chaos of a single father raising a child.

But now, something felt... different. Cleaner, quieter.

Of course, he must‚Äôve sent Lily over to her grandma‚Äôs with Max. A curiously chaotic child with her dog underfoot is the last thing David wanted when he was working on a potential evolutionary breakthrough.

He led me straight to his lab, tucked into the back of the house. It was cramped with equipment‚Äîcentrifuges, gene sequencers, and cages.

Then I saw it.

It was grotesque, that much was clear. Patches of fur clung to its oddly shaped frame, with thick fur matted from neglect.

The face, though, was something altogether more disturbing‚Äîhalf-human, half-beast.

Long, dark hair obscured most of its features, but through the strands, its eyes‚Ä¶eerily human, stared back at mine.

*They seemed‚Ä¶ familiar?*

""Greet Joseph,"" David commanded.

The creature looked at me, and spoke, voice gravelly, halting at first, but coherent.

‚Äú**H-hello‚Ä¶ Joseph.**‚Äù

My mind raced, torn between the horror of what I was seeing and the scientific marvel before me.

This... thing was talking. David had done it, he had created a chimera capable of human speech.

‚ÄúI ran a few tests earlier,‚Äù David said with triumph in his voice. ‚ÄúNeural synapses are firing at human levels. It understands complex language, can follow commands‚Äîthere‚Äôs still some degradation, but... it‚Äôs an incredible step forward, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is... extraordinary, David. You‚Äôve... surpassed anything I could‚Äôve imagined.‚Äù

Pride flooded David‚Äôs features.

‚ÄúWhere did you find the dog for your test subject?‚Äù

David‚Äôs smile faltered. He didn‚Äôt answer.

‚ÄúDavid?‚Äù I pressed, a coldness creeping up my spine. ‚ÄúSurely, you didn‚Äôt... use Max?‚Äù

I felt my pulse quicken as I studied the chimera‚Äôs face again. The familiarity in those unmistakably human eyes‚Ä¶

Suddenly, it clicked.

I froze, my stomach churning. No, it couldn‚Äôt be...

Slowly, I turned back to David.

‚ÄúDavid‚Ä¶‚Äù My throat tightened.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Lily?‚Äù

"Brian, Ingrid, and the condom dispute; two different stories",698,1g3w4cy,90DayFiance,https://www.reddit.com/r/90DayFiance/comments/1g3w4cy/brian_ingrid_and_the_condom_dispute_two_different/,156,1728955033.0,"Brian claims that he didn‚Äôt have a condom, so he suggested they engage in oral sex instead. As he was kissing her stomach and moving downward, she changed her mind and put a stop to things. He said that he thought ‚Äúoral sex and a massage‚Äù would be a good compromise.

Ingrid‚Äôs version is that Brian offered oral sex since he didn‚Äôt have a condom, but she declined. She said that they ‚Äúwaited a little longer,‚Äù which seems to suggest he lingered for a while, hoping she might change her mind. When she didn‚Äôt, he became frustrated and eventually left.

Brian also made a comment implying he didn‚Äôt expect to ‚Äúgo through all that,‚Äù suggesting that he thought, given how women typically perceive him, the encounter would have gone more smoothly. This could also hint at a stereotype he holds, thinking that because she‚Äôs Latina, she might be more open to no condom sex.

I‚Äôm saying this from a guys perspective; I think Brian is the dirtbag here

It seems like Brian is the type who believes a woman‚Äôs insistence on using a condom =  not interest in him. He probably also sees asking him to wear a condom as a form of disrespect 

He purposely didn‚Äôt bring a condom, knowing sex could be a possibility, and hoped oral sex would get her horned up enough to overlook it.

TLC/other cast members if you‚Äôre reading this, I REALLY hope someone goes in on him about this. It‚Äôs really predatory behavior and deserves to be called out, especially on the subject of sex and personal health"

This is all too common and I guess I don‚Äôt really know how common it is outside of the USMC infantry.

When I was in I literally saw people cough up blood and worse and they were told to drink more water. This was in Garrison!!!! Not like we‚Äôre on a mission to kill bin Laden and it can wait.

I had a disc popped out of my back and literally could not manouver my way to be seen for it. I had to fight my command, take leave, and get an MRI by a civilian doctor, then basically shove it right under their nose. ‚ÄúOh yea fuck man you need major surgery right away‚Äù. Yea no fucking shit huh?

Then even after my surgery. ‚ÄúBrokedick‚Äù ‚Äúoh how‚Äôs your spinafuckalitis‚Äù ‚Äúprobably just faking it to get out of going to the field‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhat a bitch he just wants to get medsepped and get on disability‚Äù etc. Being in an infantry unit after my surgery was depressing and humiliating tbh.

If a civilian from the VA even saw half of what even the CO or first sergeant did/said it would be on the fucking news. 

Why doesn‚Äôt the VA acknowledge that some people don‚Äôt have documentation from shit if they weren‚Äôt allowed? I can‚Äôt even imagine if I had something serious that wasn‚Äôt visible by MRI.

If I was allowed, there would definitely be things that I would tell the VA yea I wanted to go for this. Well why didn‚Äôt you? Well I was a fucking boot at that time and didn‚Äôt even rate to ask lmaoooo.

I was devastated by this. Him, not so much. It was not a planned pregnancy, I was about 8 weeks in. Although we agreed on kids prior to marriage, this was not the ""time"" according to him. 

His reaction to me being pregnant was to be angry asking why why why repeatedly. He threw the positive test in the trash, not wanting to look at it. While I'm just staring in shock at his reaction.

We've been together in total 10 years and have been married almost 3 of those years. 

I was utterly devastated at his reaction. Not what I had envisioned at all. He never really seemed to be to ecstatic about it, and then I ended up losing the pregnancy.

I was so sad and upset, he took care of me and showed me love. Love he didn't show me when I was pregnant. Almost like the loss was a relief.

I told him about how all of his actions hurt me immensely, we got in the worst argument we've ever had. He apologized, we talked and made up and we agreed to try for a baby at the beginning of next year - (2 & 1/2 months away)

The past month, we had a lot of unprotected sex. 

And what do you know. 

I'm pregnant.

When I put the test on the counter he looks at me with disbelief and asks me ""HOW""? 

He then proceeded to take the test and forcefully toss it in the trash while saying ""get this out of my fucking face"".

Please help me.

Full bottles pictured here:

Glossier You: Spring (note: I wanted Byredo Young Rose but it's sooo expensive, this was second best for a freshie. Now I lowkey regret not just spending the money...oh well, when I run out!)

He's a gentle soul, so loving and cuddly. Such a good boy, so into people, almost too social. We've settled into a nice routine now: walk at dawn, drive over to 2nd home to chill for a couple hours with much musical activity, then back home to eat around 10am. Then chill for a while in the afternoon, most likely involving nap time in his crate. Late afternoon pee break, then dinner at 5. Evening walk, then wind down, and he'll sleep through the night in his crate. Rinse and repeat.

His only flaw remains dog reactivity while on leash. He makes a strange whine that can elevate into a high pitched squeal. He's getting better, I try to get him to stay with me, have come to some sort of agreement regarding leash corrections accompanied by a big slow NOOOOO. We mostly avoid the crowd anyways so most of the time it's a nice relaxing peaceful walk. 

Love him so much! So nice to have a dog I'm so connected with. Almost adopted another dog first, but that somehow fell through. Thankful to have found and wound up with the Churro now, these things just have a way of working themselves out."

Internships are a crucial step in shaping your career, whether you aim to become a top-notch developer, a researcher, or a problem-solver in any domain. This guide is here to demystify the internship process and give you a roadmap to secure a high-quality internship. Read on to find out how to maximize your chances of getting into top companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and many more. üí°

---

**1. Why Are Internships Important?**
   
- Real-World Experience: Textbooks teach you the 'what,' but internships teach you the 'how.'
   - Networking: Build connections with professionals and mentors.
   - Resume Booster: Internships from renowned companies can make your CV stand out during placements.
   - Financial Perks: Many internships come with stipends, making them a great way to earn while learning.

---

**2. When Should You Start Applying?**
  
 - 1st & 2nd Year: Focus on building skills and working on personal projects. Look for startups or unpaid internships to get your foot in the door.
   - 3rd Year: Prime time to target big companies like Google, Microsoft, or startups with great growth potential.
   - 4th Year: If you haven‚Äôt done an internship yet, apply aggressively for last-minute opportunities or pre-placement offers (PPOs).

---

**3. How to Find Internship Opportunities?**
  
 - On-Campus Drives: Colleges often invite companies for campus placements. Stay updated through your placement cell.
   - Job Portals: Use platforms like:
     - Internshala: Best for beginners, internships across various domains.
     - LinkedIn: Network with recruiters and follow companies to get notified of opportunities.
     - Naukri, AngelList, and Indeed: Good for both tech and non-tech internships.
   - Company Careers Pages: Visit the official career pages of target companies and keep an eye on their ""Internship"" section.
   - Referrals: This is a game-changer. Reach out to seniors, alumni, or industry professionals for referrals.

---

**4. What Are Companies Looking For?**
  
 - Strong Technical Skills: Master at least one programming language like Python, Java, or C++. For machine learning, dive deep into Python; for backend, learn Java.
   - Projects: Show off 2-3 solid projects on GitHub or personal portfolio websites. Example projects could include:
     - Web Apps: Full-stack applications using React, Node.js, Django.
     - ML Models: A simple image classifier using TensorFlow.
     - Blockchain Projects: Build a basic decentralized app (dApp).
   - Competitive Coding: Solve problems on LeetCode, Codeforces, or HackerRank. Many companies use these platforms for assessments.
   - Soft Skills: Good communication skills can set you apart during interviews. Practice by explaining your projects to friends or family.

---

**5. How to Build an Impressive Resume?**
  
 - Keep it Crisp: A one-page resume is ideal for most internships.
   - Highlight Key Skills: Put your technical skills and projects right at the top.
   - Quantify Achievements: Instead of saying ""worked on a web app,"" say ""built a web app that reduced load time by 30%.""
   - GitHub & LinkedIn Links: Include links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn for recruiters to check out.

---

**6. Cracking the Internship Interview**
  
 - Aptitude & Coding Round: Practice data structures, algorithms, and basic aptitude questions.
   - Technical Interviews: Be ready to explain your projects and solve live coding challenges.
   - System Design: For backend roles, prepare for basic system design questions (e.g., designing a URL shortener).
   - Behavioral Questions: Be genuine and use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to answer questions like:
     - ""Tell me about a time you faced a challenge in a project.""
     - ""Why do you want to join our company?""

---

**7. Top Platforms for Practicing Coding:**
  
 - LeetCode: For Data Structures & Algorithms (focus on Google, Microsoft, Amazon tag).
   - CodeChef & Codeforces: For competitive programming (participate in monthly contests).
   - GeeksforGeeks: For learning new concepts.
   - Exercism: A great place for coding practice in over 50 programming languages.

---

**8. Do‚Äôs & Don‚Äôts During the Internship Application Process**
   
- Do:
     - Customize Your Resume: Tailor it for each company.
     - Follow Up: A polite email post-interview shows your interest.
     - Build a Portfolio: Showcase your projects and certificates online.
  
- Don‚Äôt:
     
- Spam Applications: Focus on quality over quantity.
     - Copy-Paste Cover Letters: Make each cover letter personal and relevant to the role.
     - Ignore Non-Paid Opportunities: Some startups offer priceless learning even if the stipend is low or zero.

---

**9. Resources to Ace Internships:**
   
- Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.
   - System Design Primer on GitHub.
   - Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy by Narasimha Karumanchi.
   - LeetCode Premium(optional) : For access to company-specific questions.
   - YouTube Channels: ""Andrei Neagoie,"" ""Tech With Tim,"" and Hitesh Choudhary.

---

**10. Final Words: Play the Long Game!**
 
 -Think Like a Founder: Don't just be an intern; think about how you can add value to the company.
  - Continuous Learning: Never stop learning, even if it‚Äôs just 15 minutes a day on a new skill or technology.
  - Build Relationships: Your seniors and mentors can open doors for you later.

Remember, internships are the first step to an illustrious career, but they‚Äôre not the last. Approach this with the mindset of learning and growing, and you‚Äôll go further than you ever imagined.

While the girl's father has abandoned her, perhaps out of jealousy or as a way of asserting emotional control over her mother, he came and took their refrigerator and a nice stove from the house saying they are his. The man abused his lady, was physically violent to the mother of his child, and after the woman having grown tired of such a a$$hole and is trying to be happy with my brother, this man tried in every possible way to destroy the life of a girl he used to call his daughter.

Man, when my dad heard of this he did not think twice. He went ahead and took his 10 year old stove and just carried it to my brother's house! He went back home without a stove, claiming he doesn‚Äôt need one, that he can eat anything (he is 63 years old). Dad can barely afford to buy things for his own house, but brought that for his daughter‚Äôs family from his house so that his granddaughter will not starve simply because the man who happens to be her father is wicked.

I have never actually been so proud of him, as I am proud of him now. He has been taking care of us all his life, from driving a truck to, even in retirement, he was a better man than any one from his age group that I have known. I teach English lessons and my income is not much, but I am keeping all the money that I can to purchase a stove for my father. I will buy that cooker back for him. He truly deserves that!

I was at the time doing a 3 weeks organized trek in western Africa (Mauritania) a few years ago and stumbled upon this rock in the sand (there are a lot of rocks in the desert but not usually black so it attracted my attention and decided to bring it back as a souvenir, despite the weight). I don't know what is it but somes professor/specialists I contacted the same year (autumn 2019) by email (at a University of geology/mineralogy of Paris) was pretty interested. We had a meeting planned at the time so he could take a look at it. But unfortunately covid kicked in, the professor retired given me a number of one of his younger colleague but a few months per year they're not available and not even in the country/university, doing field work several months around summer so contact became harder. I didn't do a follow up, so it's basically a paper weight, but I'm still interested to know what is it.

It's quite dense and heavy for the size (a bit more than two packs of cigarettes do give you an idea of the volume), ""smooth""on the touch, around 850gr, some parts are attracted to magnets. I have others pics including some close ups of the surface but reddit seems to only allow me to upload one.

I can make an album somewhere if someone is interested/curious too. For the very close ups I used at my best a digital 100x microscope but it's quite complicated to use. I can made a specific Pic of a part too once home. "

It's my 2nd building.

For the 1st building I went through the awful task for priming with craft acrylic and watered down PVA, blah, so dull, so agonising, so blah.

My plan with this one is to just blast it with the liquitex (foam safe), paint the detail and then varnish.

In your experience, will skipping a PVA prime be detrimental?

SW: 210lbs
CW: 149.6lbs
GW: first goal was 150lbs, new goal: 140lbs

I've been waiting to share my story and I think now is as good of time as any since I've met my first goal of 150lbs (down 60lbs since Feb). Never in my entire adult life have I been this weight or even close to it...in fact I've been overweight my entire life.

I started with 18:6 for approx 4 weeks then transitioned to 20:4 mostly with some 24hr, 36hr, 42hr and 48hrs sprinkled in weekly. I've also tried a 68 hr fast in Sept. 

My window is often 12-4pm or 2-6pm. Sometimes I have longer windows on the weekend as I find it harder to stick to around the kids and fun things we plan.

My kids are 5 and 1, my youngest was 7 months old when I started IF. I work from home for our family business and use black coffee and warm water to help curb hunger. I don't restrict any foods but find I naturally eat protein, good fats and veggies/fruits for carbs as opposed to the ultra processed food I used to eat all day long. I still like my desserts and chocolate but have cut way, way back.

I enjoy running and have had some of my best exercises in the fasted state. I hit a personal best of 5km in 32 mins which I was stoked about.

I think I have about 10-20lbs to go but I'm so relaxed in to the process that I know it'll happen eventually. I just bought my first ever bikini and I know I'll be able to wear it by next summer! I look OK in it now but I know I'll wear it with great confidence next summer! 

Stay motivated, and enjoy the process! "
‚Ä¶So someone filmed me in the dining hall,580,1g3wqtn,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1g3wqtn/so_someone_filmed_me_in_the_dining_hall/,35,1728956997.0,"I just had to write about this really strange occurrence that happened to me at dinner today.

I was eating dinner with my friend and I was listening to something she was saying in our conversation, shooting the shit about work, when I noticed the table of dude bros sitting in front of us (I was facing them). One of them was sitting at the head of their table and it initially looked like he was taking a close selfie, with the phone camera pointed in my direction. After a few seconds, or however long it takes to take a selfie in a reasonable amount of time, I had the feeling that I was being watched.

I noticed that when I moved my body around, his camera mirrored my movements. I continued to listen to my friend for the next minute or so before I confronted him. I said to him, ""Excuse me, are you filming something behind me?"" I turned around and there was literally nothing behind me; no one was there.

I was getting more creeped out and annoyed so I asked him more directly, ""Hey why are you filming me?"". He put his phone on his lap and just stared at me. He didn't say anything or acknowledge me, but I could tell that he knew I was talking to him. After trying to get his attention a few more times, I could see that he sent something on Snapchat. I loudly told my friend that I was uncomfortable and we left.

I can't shake the feeling that he was filming me and sent the video to someone on Snapchat. I work on campus and I'm worried that this guy might be trying to stalk me or something. I'll look out for more suspicious activity but I have no idea what they were planning to do with that video."

These are ILLEGAL, not unethical, and frankly lazy for creative sods like yourselves. 

Can we relegate illegal tips to/r/IllegalLifeProTips, and stick with unethical in here? 

A good example is plausible deniability: putting ghost pepper sauce in your lunch that is constantly stolen by a dickish coworker is unethical, because you can plausibly explain that you really enjoy spicy food, and if someone else ate it, it's their own fault for spending an hour on the toilet.

Putting laxatives in the same lunch is illegal: you're causing bodily harm, and there's no plausible reason why you'd do that that a court would believe. 

I'm getting pedantic here, so if you're pissed off, don't key my car: instead, get two friends to park their cars so close to my front and rear bumpers that I can't possibly move it easily, and then pour sugar on the ground near my gas tank so I think you've poured sugar in my gas tank, and I waste time and money going to a mechanic to check to make sure."

A family with a service dog got on the shuttle at the last moment and the group ended up splitting up. My parents were across from me, and the parents of the other group were to their right, while their two kids (a teen and an adult) were to my right with the service dog being with the teen.

The dog seemed a little restless and kept leaning against my leg, its ears kept brushing against my hand, and a few times it even rested its head on my knee. I thought maybe it was looking over at the parents or something when it did so. I did my best to pay no attention to it, because it was a service dog. I don't know much about training dogs, especially not service dogs, plus this was a stranger's dog so I figured the best course of action was to do nothing to encourage the behavior and ignore the dog completely. And I like dogs so this was a little bit torturous. I just had to keep focusing on the fact that I could pet my parents' dog all I wanted when we got back to their house haha.

After the shuttle dropped us off, I was joking to my parents about the dog and how it had drooled a bit on my leg and how badly I wanted to pet it. Then my mom told me she'd heard the other mom saying that the dog was alerting.

It honestly hadn't even occurred to me that that was what the dog was doing. I just hope it was an anxiety alert dog, because I already know I have anxiety, and not a ""you're about to die"" service dog."

Don't get me wrong- I had a blast the first 18 months or so on console. But this update was such a massive change and almost entirely for the better.

 I was heavily into pvp at the time and my Ebonheart teammates were really put out by the idea we'd actually see players from offer factions in our cities, especially Mournhold. That was our home. It was the best damn capital in the game and we did not want to see our enemies there. But in the scale of what the update did it that was utterly trivial.

All enemies were scaled to the same level everywhere for the first time. This was massive. You could no longer out level zones... I really can't emphasize enough how futile questing felt when you were overleveled and, in addition to combat being farcically easy, got zero xp for kills and zero loot from enemies. Questing just felt so pointless most of the time.

Then you have all the sets that were added, the standardization of drops into loot pools and standardization of how they were bound. Everything just kind of clicked into place and the game became so much more fun.

And the account widening of champion ranks... before this you had to level each character to champion rank 160 to hit the gear cap. It was brutal.

We also all knew housing was coming, I think it came out 6 months later in around March 2017. Not long after One Tamriel dropped they added all the original houses to the game. We couldn't go inside yet but we could peak over the walls. Me and my friends gots so excited just jumping up and down peaking over the fence into the one on Stros M'Kai.

I guess I'm kinda ranting as I reminisce at this point. Happy 10th anniversary ESO family. If I could do it all over again I wouldn't change a damn thing.

I had an incredible day where a mutual friend of mine and my ex-wife‚Äôs(separated 2 weeks now) came over to learn about my struggle with dysphoria, listen to my side of what‚Äôs all happened and to offer her love and support. I knew if I went into boy-mode for our hangout, she would have been offended that I didn‚Äôt trust her. So I stayed in girl mode and we had the most wonderful time.

I have never felt less judged and more seen by another human being.

Toward the end of our hangout, my ex texted to say she had a thanksgiving plate for me from her parent‚Äôs family gathering that she wanted to drop off. So, I brought our mutual friend home and decided that my apartment is the one place where I shouldn‚Äôt have to adapt myself for anyone else, so I stayed in full girl mode for when she showed up, only I wasn‚Äôt wearing my fake boobs(I‚Äôm pre HRT). 

When she arrived I went downstairs to let her in. She took one look at me, handed me the plate of food and said ‚ÄúHave a good night‚Äù as she turned and left. To feel so seen and then so rejected within hours of each other is too f*ing much to bear. I‚Äôm currently trying to keep a nervous breakdown at bay and typing this out is keeping me distracted. To not exist again feels like the only escape from this pain, but I promised to myself years ago that for the sake of my children I would never take action on any such thought. So now I sit here in agony. Alone. "

Hearing the word ""shit"" turn into ""s\_\_\_t"" every other minute, and then having to take a sec to figure out what Dan & Arin actually said, makes me feel like my brain has the hiccups. Especially since GG is such a stream-of-consciousness show.



I understand that it's just better for business if the boys keep the videos curse-free. Today's sponsor probably wasn't super keen about the number of ""fucks"" per minute, so the edit needed a little more trimming. I get it, it makes sense, and I don't blame GG for it... it's just *so annoying*.



It's annoying that companies are incentivized to only sponsor content that's ""clean.""



It's annoying that a sponsor gets to decide what ""clean"" means to them, and bend the episode accordingly.



Fundamentally, it's annoying that curse words are still such a taboo. As Dan himself once said: ""it's just a fuckin' sound.""

I didn‚Äôt answer so caller texted me and told me she was my ex‚Äôs wife. She asked that we speak over the phone rather than text so i obliged. Let‚Äôs call his wife Brooklyn and ex will be Jason. So Brooklyn begin telling me she was calling due to something serious and to hear her out. She tells me how she feels that Jason never fully got over me. 
I like umm ok. She follows up with how this has been a point of conflict in their marriage and they have even went to counseling to move forward. But Jason really does still love me. 
To say I was flabbergasted is an understatement. I dated Jason when I was 19 so about 12 years ago. She was crying and told me how she has always felt like the other woman. So I assured her I have no feeling for him due to our relationship never being serious. We dated for 2 months. I found out I was pregnant during our relationship and got back with my then baby daddy turned husband. Jason did help out during the beginning of pregnancy just due to me losing housing and us starting off as good friends. 
Sorry I‚Äôm rambling but like I don‚Äôt understand how he still loves me. But back to the convo, she told me of how basically cyber stalks me. And he is thinking about asking me out to dinner. 
I ended the call early due to me feeling uneasy. Like he really thinks I‚Äôm going to actually date him. Like I‚Äôm scared cause he has me on all social platforms and if I block him now I don‚Äôt know what he will do. Especially since he is cyberstalking me. I‚Äôm afraid to tell my husband due to the fact he believes I led him on. I just need advice on what to do with this new found information "

"M7 Class of 2016, graduated with $150k in debt. Just hit $1M networth today!",542,1g3wqug,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1g3wqug/m7_class_of_2016_graduated_with_150k_in_debt_just/,132,1728956998.0,"I remember being back in this sub a decade ago, being worried about the debt level. I also remember a lack of information on salary and such more than 2-3 years out. Figured I'd share my story since I finally hit the milestone I had dreamed about since I was a working class 8 year old. 

My net worth graph is here:

https://imgur.com/a/7j92b9o

Hit $1M 8 years and 4 days after I started my post-MBA job. As you can see, things start slow, but then compound as you get both market gains, and much higher comp once you hit director level.

I did consulting directly after MBA, left the minute I was promoted (hated it), joined a corporate strategy team as a VP1, was promoted to director in 3 years, and am finishing my third year as director. I'd say my outcome is around average for my class. A ton of people I know are doing front office finance for $$$$, consulting partners, $$$ tech jobs (those not laid off at least), etc.. Although a decent number of people I know are still in $250k jobs...generally the less motivated ones. I don't really know anyone who is doing poorly. It's all good to great. 

I live in NYC in a $5500 rent apt with my wife and young child. I spend $70k a year on childcare. My wife makes low $100ks. Providing my numbers only, but my wife also has an incremental $300k saved in her retirement accounts. Wouldn't consider myself particularly frugal, but try not to waste money on luxury goods either. I do spend money to make my life easier though and to have fun.

My yearly cash earnings were as follows according to social security website (note: this underplays my earnings a tiny bit, since i don't record the earnings until RSU's vest, which may take 2-3 years. Also my bonus is in January, so that delays earnings by a year for tax purposes).

Year	Cash

2025E: I expect 5% comp increase (although actuals will be higher due to RSU's vesting), although I'm in final rounds for a job that will pay $550-600k. 

2024E: ~$390-400k ($245k Base, and got $140k Bonus in January 2024...plus my director level RSU's are finally fully vesting) 

2023:	$359,128 

2022:	$296,456 (1st year as Director, got promoted in 3 years)
 
2021:	$231,805 

2020:	$224,415 

2019:	$192,978 (stub bonus this year, which makes me comp look artificially low)

2018:	$242,758 (top bucket in consulting, promoted to engagement manager, changed jobs end of year which got me some extra money due to signing bonus. Joined a Corporate Strategy team at a bank as a VP1) 

2017:	$186,058 

2016:	$82,276 (started consulting job post-mba, mostly signing bonus)

2015:	$30,245 (internship money)

2014:	$52,301 (would've made $100k if I didnt quit to start my MBA. Started 2Y MBA in fall 2014)

2013:	$83,447 (job hopped)

2012:	$70,072 

2011:	$70,354 

2010:	$62,174 

2009:	$45,041 (graduated during financial crisis, got worse job than I wanted. $80k in undergrad debt too, fun times)

2008:	$22,316 (paid internship)

2007:	$18,719 (paid internship)

2006:	$4,109 (retail, work study) 

2005:	$0 (working off the books at a flea market)

2004:	$2,634 (telemarketer)

2003:	$2,405 (telemarketer)

Lastly, I looked forward to this milestone my whole life, and I feel nothing. So that sucks haha."

Most of the comments are variation of ""just lower starting ELO"" (also includeing sorting matches against AI) and I'm tired of explaining it just doesn't work. Therefore, I've written down a mathematical proof. It shows that if you lower starting Elo (to 800 here but works for any valu), average Elo gradually lowers to that starting Elo and we have the same issue we started with. Without other measures to mitigate this (like artificially inflating Elo if average drops down too much), it is NOT a solution.

It‚Äôs a small one bedroom apartment, I live alone, I leave lights off, and I barely use the stove/oven.   Tonight while I was in the basement after filling the oil tank with 30 gallons of diesel from 3 different cans (2 trips to the gas station) because we ran out of oil and have no heat (for about the 12th time since I‚Äôve been here) My next door neighbor is a mechanical tech and works with boilers and furnaces a lot, he came over to help me get the furnace bled and started up.  He told me ‚Äúyou know this furnace is running off of your mete right?‚Äù  He then switched off a breaker for the basement and not only did the furnace cut out but all the basement lights cut out (which upstairs people always leave on after doing laundry).  Mind you, the furnace is tied in to both the first and second floor, it heats both.   He told me by law that the community appliances are supposed to be on a separate meter paid for by the landlord.
Then I got curious and we started tracing wires back to my box.  Turns out that not only is my hot water heater wired in to my supply but so is the second floor hot water heater, and so is the washer and dryer (shared).  So for the past five years I‚Äôve been paying the electricity for the furnace, the basement lights, both first and second floor hot water heaters, and the washer dryer.  Makes sense why my bill is between $250-$275/mo for a small one bedroom apartment.   
This seems illegal and extremely shady at the least.  
The second floor tenant told me that the landlord charges him an extra $100/mo and includes his electricity in his rent and the landlord has the bill in his name for the 2nd floor.
Do I have any recourse?

i used to hate purses and refused to carry one. now i can‚Äôt imagine an outfit without a completing purse! and as we all know, coach is immaculate when it comes to quality and craftsmanship. 

it‚Äôs an expensive hobby, and i‚Äôm definitely in coach jail right now. i went crazy in the beginning, but i purged a lot and curated my collection now (i used to have an ergo flap bag in black and an ergo pocket shoulder bag in mustard yellow a couple years ago when they were cheaper, but i sold them long ago. kicking myself now). the majority of my vintage collection was found for under $80 :) (excluding the purple hamptons, suede green soho, and cherry red soho. beautiful rare babies, all found under $180)

i definitely want to be conscious and intentional going forth with my collection. i want to wear and love each & every bag! so it‚Äôs crucial that i only add and keep what is unique, wearable, and lovable to me. also i‚Äôm broke and can only spend the $ if its 100% worth it, let‚Äôs be honest. currently, my collection thus far is curated perfectly for me and i‚Äôve held back on lots of online buys to appreciate what i have and what‚Äôs similar! the only bag on my wishlist right now is a brooklyn 28 in black :) and whatever unique (enough for my collection) and beautiful bags the thrift gods decide to bless me with in the second hand world ü¶ãüçÑ‚Äçüü´‚òîÔ∏è‚òÅÔ∏èüçãüçÇüçíü•ùüåßÔ∏èüåûüçÅ love yall and this community!"

Jemand hat gestern Abend auf mein EG Hochparterre Balkon geklettert und mein armes Graspflanzen versucht abzuhacken. Der war nur zum Teil erfolgreich. Mein Gras Pflanze hat extrem kleine Buds durch Sonnen Mangel also es ist kein gro√ües Verlust. Der hat nichts anders geklaut und war anscheinend extrem schnell. Trotzdem, was f√ºr ein Arschloch!

Ja, nat√ºrlich war das ein Risiko die Pflanzen drau√üen im EG Balkon zu lassen. Ich hatte leider kein Wahl da ich vor kurzem hier umgezogen bin und der schon riesig war.

Ich habe der Einbruch bei meinem Vermieter gemeldet. Er kann nichts tun.

Frage: was kann ich selber tun um mein Balkon zu sch√ºtzen? Meint ihr, der kommt wieder?

Ideen:
Graspflanzen kommt ab heute jeden Abend drin in die Wohnung.
Ganz viel Stacheldraht kaufen und an meiner Balkonwand anbringen.

Vielen Dank!

**AITA for telling my father that it was his fault he missed my son's first birthday party?**

&#x200B;

My son turned one this past weekend. On Sunday, my husband and I threw a birthday party for him at a local kids venue. We confirmed the date, with both the venue and our guests, a few months ago. One of those guests was my father. Back when I informed him of the date, he told me he'd come.

A few days before the party, he asked if there was any way for me to reschedule it. I said no, as we'd already confirmed everything with the venue. My father then told me he'd be late to the party because there was an event at his girlfriend's church on the same day, and she wanted him to attend.

I should say that my immediate family, including my father, is technically catholic, but none of us practice it. However, my father's girlfriend is VERY religious. Like, Jesus as her phone wallpaper religious. Since they started dating (a little over a year ago), my father has been attending church with her on a semi-regular basis. He has explicitly told me he doesn't like it, but does it to make her happy.

I told my father I was fine with him being late, as long as he came to the party at some point. He said he'd show up as soon as the church event was done.

A few hours before the party ended, my father texted me the event was still going, and he thought ""it would be in poor taste"" for him to leave early, so he probably wouldn't be able to come. I didn't hear from him again that day.

On Monday, my father called me to explain that the event went on for longer than he expected. He didn't apologize, but asked if I was angry at him, and I said yes.

He said he had no way of knowing the event would last as long as it did, but that's not what I'm upset about. I told him he still chose to prioritize an event he didn't even want to attend over his grandson's first birthday party, made several other choices that led him to completely miss the latter, and didn't inform me about any of that until the last minute. All of those decisions were his, so the fact he ultimately didn't come to the party was his fault.

My father is still refusing to apologize, and insists I have no right to be angry over something he had ""no control over.""

I'm starting to feel odd about this. My husband is on my side, but my sister told me I'm being dramatic.

AITA?

*NTA. He made his choice, asked if your were upset, was told ‚Äúyes‚Äù you were to which he said well actually I was expecting you to placate MY feelings about missing the party and prioritizing my gf (who is an adult) over my grandson. Don‚Äôt. You seriously do not need to soothe his feelings. Say to him clearly once more, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm upset you chose to miss the party. Why you missed it is beside the point. It‚Äôs not like you were in the ER with a ruptured spleen after a massive car wreck. You were with your gf. Period‚Äù. He doesn‚Äôt get a free pass on your feelings just because he values his own comfort over yours.*

>OOP: During that first phone call, it did kind of feel like he thought he was a victim. As if missing his grandson's birthday party was something that had happened to him, not something his own decisions had led to.

&#x200B;

**Tough-Combination-37**

*That is classic emotional immaturity. ‚ÄúThe gf made me‚Ä¶you made me‚Ä¶it went long so it wasn‚Äôt my fault‚Ä¶I had no choice‚Äù etc etc. Lame.*

&#x200B;

**Odd\_West\_8860**

*NTA. Your father is an adult, and he made a choice to attend a different event. He asked if you were upset, and you answered him honestly. He chose his girlfriend over his grandchild. It's understandable to be disappointed in him and upset that he made the choices he's made. It's very possible he'll do this again in the future.*

*I do think hanging onto your anger only eats away at you, though. Doesn't seem to be bothering him all that much. Make peace with the fact that he's going to choose the girlfriend. Adulting sucks sometimes.*

>OOP: I don't plan on hanging on to my anger or anything, but I'm definitely still upset. My father has an odd work schedule, so this isn't the first important event he misses, but it's the first he chose to miss.

&#x200B;

Hey guys. I intended to update sooner, but I've been busy these days.

I think my main takeaway from your comments was that it's not my job to placate my father's feelings. He made several conscious decisions that led him to miss the birthday party. He had the right to make those choices, but the consequences were, indeed, his fault.

After deliberating for a while, I called my father to discuss the subject again. I told him I don't expect him to apologize, and I won't hold resentment towards him forever, but he can't expect me to pretend his actions didn't anger me, or that it wasn't his fault. We had a long discussion about it.

Throughout all of it, my father kept trying to play the victim. He'd talk about how he wanted to come to the party, and was upset he'd missed it. At one point he said, ""You don't understand, I didn't want to go to the church.""

I told him I don't care, what matters is that he did. He could have told his girlfriend he didn't want to go, but he didn't. He could have left the church early, but he didn't. He could have prioritized his previous commitment and not attended the event in the first place, but he didn't. Everything he did that day was within his control.

I won't get into the specifics of the discussion itself, but I will say that it took a while. I explained that if he wants to prioritize his girlfriend over his grandchild, the least he can do is be upfront about it. That means either not making promises he can't keep or acknowledging his responsibility when he makes regretful decisions.

My father did end up apologizing (and, more importantly, taking accountability). I forgave him, but I intend to be wary from now on. Looking back, I don't feel like I was ever able to truly rely on my father. Back then, he would miss events because he had a complicated work schedule. But now that I know he's also capable of doing that willingly, I don't want to enable it.

If my father ever prioritizes anything, be it a girlfriend or an event, over a commitment he made to my son again, I will stop inviting him. Same goes for any children my husband and I have in the future. I've informed my father of that, and he agreed.

His girlfriend, from what I've heard, is pissed at me, but I could care less.

This will be my only update. I don't think I have anything else to add, but feel free to ask me any questions you may have. Thank you for your feedback on my last post.

*You did good. People need to realize they are free to live their life and make their choices but they can‚Äôt act all offended when their choices bite them in the rear. Your dad seems to have sadly prioritized other things above you and good for you in setting him straight*

&#x200B;

**Fleurtheleast**

>""You don't understand, I didn't want to go to the church.""

*Unless he was dragged there at gunpoint, I don't see how he could try to claim this was anyone's fault but his own. He made a series of choices but wants to act like his hands were tied. At his age he should know how to stand up for himself and not be strong-armed into these kinds of situations, and to stop expecting a pity party when he disappoints people.*

*Good on you for not letting him wiggle out of his accountability.*

*As for the girlfriend, what does SHE have to be mad about? She got what she wanted! She can get bent.*

>OOP: I think my father told her he's not going to her church anymore. I can't be certain, but he told me he wanted to do that.

>Anyway, I don't think she's my biggest fan.

I mostly brushed it off, and she stopped bringing it up once I did get my license. But recently she was talking to a customer and they were talking about driving and people getting their license later was brought up, the customer said ""i don't know why people wait to get their license"". 


As soon as he said that, my coworker looked at me and said ""yeah op tell us,"" so I said, ""I had trauma with cars at the time."" The customer then said ""oh so you're afraid of a little car."" That upset me more, so i replied ""no was abused in a car on multiple occasions, and it caused me to feel unsafe and have panic attacks in cars. "" Coworker immediately stopped looking at me, and the customer moved the conversation along."

This should've been free.,583,1g3vzox,WWEGames,https://i.redd.it/2t0vitmtltud1.jpeg,141,1728954642.0,"So, since my last post I had some time to rethink and I've come to an conclusion that this DLC should've been a free update. Here's 3 Reasons why, 1. Could've been a Uncle Howdy Model update to Bo Dallas, and Action Figure Bray most definitely would've worked as a Free Locker Code Persona Card. The '24 Fiend makes the most sense being just an Free Addon with Fiend Championship. 2. Overall 2K24 is basically over and CC is the only think keeping it alive. At this point no one is willing to pay more money for something that will be implemented in 2K25 for Free anyway. 3. Overall it feels just disgusting to put price tag on a Legacy like Bray Wyatt's. Sure no one is forcing you to buy this pack, but that doesn't mean it's right for 2K to monopolise off an Icon. Heck they didn't even show the initiative to update Uncle Howdys Attire or to just fix Fiends looped them. 

(I just hope 2K doesn't do this shit with 2K25 or they'll try a different cycle of release like every 2 Years. But that's just me.)"

Had to say goodbye to Winston today. It feels awful. ,564,1g3w2cu,bettafish,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g3w2cu,43,1728954867.0,"The coolest fish I've ever owned. 

A Facebook marketplace rescue that was in my care for about 5-6 months. 

He came is a small sad bowl, I dropped $300 on a 10 gal tank with as many live plans and accommodations as I could. He was so happy!

He ate all my meals with me at home, would come say hi every time you sat at his table, and would swim through my fingers if I made a hoop shape. 

I never knew fish could have this much personality. I loved this little guy so much. 

He was in his previous owners care for 1.5 years, a petco fish cared for by a child. I can assume he was possibly at least 2.5 to 3 years old at his time of passing. 


He started showing signs of age/illness slowly. I thought it was an illness and tried to treat with medication before I realized he might just be getting old. He didn't have many symptoms besides being lethargic and losing his vibrancy. Then the swim bladder issues started so I added extra fish rests and hammocks. He lasted about a month in his little fish hospice before we decided we needed to euthanize him. He couldn't eat his food, he was always sleeping and gasping, it was just an awful sight. 


Warning. Below I'm going to discuss how he was euthanized and what didn't seem to go well.

I am not sure how I feel about clove oil as a humane form of passing. I followed the directions meticulously and it still seemed to go wrong. I added it slowly and carefully. He unfortunately woke up about 30 min in  (after adding the recommended amount, well mixed with water over the course of 30 min). He was not having a good time (he began swimming and thrashing, i felt absolutely awful).... we opted for a much faster form when we saw he was struggling and not passing peacefully, which was unfortunately blunt force. 


I am so sad. 

I miss him so much already. 

Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, I know  my intentions were in good faith but it just feels so awful still. I worry I did not care for him well enough and that he maybe was sick, but I put everything I had into his care. His water parameters were perfect, always. Tank was clean and cycled, tons of hides, plants, and betta logs. It was a perfect temp, filtered, ideal size..... I don't know. 

I miss you Winston.  "

When I tell people I‚Äôm Israeli their manners go out the window,169,1g42ktp,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1g42ktp/when_i_tell_people_im_israeli_their_manners_go/,680,1728979121.0,"It‚Äôs honestly crazy. When I meet someone new on campus and they ask me where I‚Äôm from, the second I say I‚Äôm Israeli it seems like they forget how to act like a human.

They either start asking me super personal questions - ‚Äúdo you support this, do you identify as that‚Äù

or they just start going on Antisemetic rants. Things that I‚Äôve had people tell me include:

- Defending Kanye saying he was right (he wasn‚Äôt, guy literally said he loves Hitler)

- Jews control the economy and the government, with prominent politicians like Biden being Jewish (he‚Äôs not)

- Jews collaborated with the Nazis during WW2 with the Madagascar Plan (wtf)

It‚Äôs not like when you meet an American the first questions you ask him are ‚Äúdo you support trans rights / abortions / trump‚Äù. Why would they think these are appropriate questions to ask someone they just met? Does this happen to Russian / Ukrainian / Palestinian students as well?

EDIT: few pointers based on the comments I‚Äôve read here

* no, i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs normal to say ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm x, I‚Äôm Israeli and don‚Äôt support the Israeli government‚Äôs actions in the middle east‚Äù every time I introduce myself to someone new. Would you expect Palestinian students to introduce themselves to people like ‚Äúhello my name is x, I‚Äôm Palestinian and I don‚Äôt support the Hamas attack on civilians on October 7th‚Äù.

* no, I‚Äôm not comparing this minor pet peeve to the plight of the Palestinians. This is just a minor annoyance, I didn‚Äôt expect this post to get hundreds of comments. Obviously being bombed daily is worse

* I haven‚Äôt experienced a lot of antisemitism on campus and generally have a very good experience with people here, again this is just a minor pet peeve.

* people thinking I‚Äôm making this up are delusional lol. Just go on twitter and see how many posts straight up glorifying Hitler there are. These things are so vanilla in comparison.

Most importantly:

* I don‚Äôt mind talking about the conflict, I actually do it a lot. All I‚Äôm saying is there‚Äôs a difference between ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre Israeli? I‚Äôd love to talk about the conflict sometime‚Äù and ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre Israeli? Are you a Zionist? Do you support your government killing Palestinians?‚Äù. I‚Äôve heard both, the first one is socially appropriate (in my opinion), the second is usually just someone who immediately classifies you as something and is looking to argue or fight. Innocent till proven guilty, no?

* to the people in the comments who see this as an excuse to be islamophobic or Antisemetic fuck right off"

You ever think about how Luke gave Jabba the Hutt more chances to do the right thing than his own nephew?,932,1g3ygp0,StarWars,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/1g3ygp0/you_ever_think_about_how_luke_gave_jabba_the_hutt/,451,1728962385.0,"When Jabba had Han captured, Luke gave him a million chances to make the right choices. First, he offered to bargain.

>Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids.

In response, Jabba said no. He just took Artoo and Threepio.

Then later, Luke shows up in person and threatens Jabba.

>I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this...or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers.

In response, Jabba throws Luke in the Rancor pit.

Luke, understandably, is pissed.

>You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make.

And yet, Luke *still* offers Jabba a chance to get out of it.

>Jabba! This is your last chance! Free us, or die!

It's only after Jabba refuses *again* that Luke and the gang resort to violence, and end up killing him.

Yet with his nephew, his own blood, the boy he helped raise, he read his mind one time while he slept and hadn't yet done *anything* wrong, and his first instinctual response was to kill him. Shameful. What the hell was Rian Johnson thinking?"

Whether it is my skill or an idea, I would reconsider 100 times before being able to pitch you finally.

Back in the days when I was in college, four of my friends and I started a non-registered (we were in the process of registering it, but never could) company, which offered video services to clients.

We weren't also very sure what our offering as a company was.

All we knew was, that we would tell companies that we could make great narrative documentaries and in return, you would pay us.

We got the first client thanks to a family contact.

And then there were none!

Because none of us knew how to sell.

Unfortunately, our company never took off. All of us went our separate ways to make a living.

During my last stint as a Video Head in a startup I realized how we are all selling something or the other, all the time.

Although my job involved a lot of operations, I was selling stories to clients, the audience, and my team.

But, I never directly sold a product to a customer.

Until this Pujo, when along with two of my friends, I sold Samosas as part of the stall we had put up in a Pujo Mandap.

The first customer came when I was grossly under-prepared and didn't even have the prices of the products memorized.

I fumbled and gave a wrong quote to a few who came after her as well.

But, in the next half an hour things looked different.

People started flocking in. I started convincing people to try the other items in the stall. We weaved a narrative on how one of the products is our personal favorite.

The cash registers kept ringing.

We sold everything in a matter of 2 hours.

The best part:  returning customers who saw value in the samosas and bought the other item we built a narrative for.

A great team, a good product, and your belief in selling it can do wonders no matter what business you are in."

Then she told me ‚Äúmay pakinabang ka naman pala‚Äù. 

Nasaktan ako syempre. I'm not a breadwinner, but I provided for this family for 12 fucking years. They regularly receive a share of my salary and they're using my dependent's HMO to the max. When my dad got admitted to MakatiMed ICU mid 2021 due to COVID, HMO couldn't handle all the costs so I have no choice but to use all my 300K savings to save his life. When it comes to tech or electrical issues, I'm the one they're depending on. Pag bonuses, binibigay ko sa kanila ng buo. Halos lahat ng appliances sa bahay, ako nag provide. Lahat ng phone nila, ako bumili. They've lived like kings and queens. In spite of all these things, dalawang buwan palang ako nawawalan ng trabaho, wala na agad akong pakinabang sa kanila.

Anyone can tell me anything and I wouldn't care for any of them. But when it comes from your own family, sobrang sakit. When I was still working, I could've been deployed overseas but I refused because of them, my parents are old and I wanna look after them as best as I could. 

Pardon my rants, I just need to get this out of my system.

Yeah, well, good afternoon sa inyo."

And the same thing if unemployment or if the stability of all planets is on average less than 50%.

The Finals needs killcams, so that we can see if the enemies were tracking you through walls, or if their aim is locked on to your head.  

I know people like to pretend it's impossible because of destruction, how about just showing the wireframe of the original map with no destruction and using that to render the killcam.  

The important thing is being able to see how accurate your enemies are and if they had advanced knowledge of your position that gadgets / callouts couldn't have given them."

I do love these new Sentinel kits, which is saying a lot because the old kit was fantastic. It takes a tiny bit more work to pose the legs how you might like, but it's really just a quick snip of the guide pieces and you're off to the races. I have a second one I'll share soon, but don't want to spam the sub. Planning on a third in the near future and am brainstorming concepts for the project.

If you're Canadian, I hope you had a great long weekend and a happy Thanksgiving, for everyone else, I appreciate you stopping by!"

And you can't even blame us for becoming allies with the ""most terrible and scary creatures in the galaxy"". How is that our fault?!

But let's start from the beginning. First you called our military reserves ""Overwhelming"". You recommended us to lower our military investments. Sounds sane... But only if you'd do the same. You wanted us to lower our military not because you wanted global demilitarization, but because we were ""unfit"" for such expands. You really told us that ""Something so small should not spend so much on military"". How is that your problem? But you began to judge us.

Now so-called deathworlders never cared about it. They didn't care about our spendings and agreed to let us be... Since they were the same.

Now about this term ""Deathworlder"": After this ""misunderstanding"" of ours - you decided to check Earth for anything that wasn't ""right"". Like it's your deal. And what was your response? That we should destroy 80% of our biodiversity because it is somehow too dangerous for you. Well then don't go here! But no, you began protests and demonstrations. Someone even tried to use bio-veapons! Thank god we stopped these idiots. 

All while other deathworlders not only eagerly formed a scientific groups to research Earth - they helped us to restore a big part of biodiversity that was lost during eco-crisis.

And the last drop - you called us ""Genetic garbage protectors"". Just for the fact that we were not destroying our weakened and ill ones like you did. And as a result - there were a bunch of exo-terran foster homes invaded by some idiots, who stole our kids and sterilized them... And then asked for compensation for ""doing our job for us"". Are you... Just that much of an assholes?!

That's it. We're terminating our agreements. Thankfully, we have enough allies of our own. You can call us evil, the forces of darkness and whatever alse you want for sticking to our ways. We have new friends now!

Those you called ""Crazy hyperactive maniacs"" - are Wurr. And they are the most friendly creatures humanity ever knew, despite looking like a hybrid between a fennec and chihuahua.

Those you called ""Brain eating horror spiders"" - are... Unpronouncable for us. But we call them Veils. And they are the definition of peacefulness and kindness. It's your problem that peacefulness doesn't equal harmlessness.

Those you called ""Walking genetic deseases"" are Nefirri. And they are the best genetic scientists this galaxy ever knew. They helped us cure so many plagues and deaths! And when they are ""Playing god"" as you call it - you never mention that they are ""playing"" on the first place. Since they are the most creative and fun among all of us.

And now humanity, or as you called us ""The power of degradation in a form of a war ape"" joined the only sane part of the sentient galaxy. And you have only yourself to blame for what's coming next."

They are some of my all time favourites. But one detail always bugged me. At the end of the season 3 episode, Brother, Can you spare two dimes, Herb forgives Homer for bankrupting him in the season two episode, Oh Brother, Where art thou. Herb offers Homer a hug, and Homer hesitates and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never Hugged a Man Before‚Äù

But the first thing Homer and Herd do when they meet each in person in that season 2 episode, is hug each other.

I know pointing out continuity errors in the Simpsons is pointless, but this is a sequel episode, 1 season apart, and they even used clips from the season 2 episode

The comments were‚Ä¶ awful.  The dad will have to leave for a week a month.  He should find a new hobby to get out of the house more.  That‚Äôs a lot of emotion in the house Four girls, that‚Äôs going to be so hard.  Girls are crazy.  Just a lot of commiserating over the difficulty of having so many girls. 

I just felt so sad afterwards.  The way people talk about their daughters versus their sons is so sad.  And yeah I get it was ‚Äújoking‚Äù but it was very pointed humor.  Not just having four kids but specifically four girls.  Have we really not progressed past straight up misogyny towards having daughters? 

Oh yeah, and at least two girls old enough to understand at least some of these conversations were standing right there‚Ä¶ "

She had me show her how to use iTunes and upload songs that she wanted onto her iPhone. 

I have an extensive music library so I took the time to copy the entire thing to her computer and then asked her what songs she wanted.

Twenty three... out of thousands of songs, she only wanted to listen to twenty three songs. Ok, fine. Red flag number one, but a very soft red flag. People are free to listen to what they want.

This was after a few months of the relationship. Another few months later, and I see her being shady and hide her phone. 

So I take a look. She's having an emotional affair with an ex that she swore she never, EVER, interacted with. OK, technically she said she never ""spoke with"", but if you want to split that hair, then you can stop reading now. 

So at this point, I'm out. We ain't living together, and the relationship is less than nine months old. I'll live, even though it hurts.

So I stay the night for one last hurrah, and once we've done the deed and she's fallen asleep, I sneak down to her home office and log onto her computer. I first delete 100% of the music I copied except for one song. It's a rarely known song by an artist named Rick Astley. You probably have never heard of it.

I then copied the song 22 times and renamed each copy, plus the original to one of the songs on her tiny playlist. Hey, Ya? How about Hey, Rick!

And Betty when you call me, you can call me RICK! 

Wheel in the Sky keeps on Rick Rolling.

You get the idea. No matter what song she chose, she got my boy Ricky.

Then I synched it with her iTunes and her phone. 

I left in the morning and never spoke with her again, but I sometimes wonder how long it took her to unfuck her songlist, considering she no longer had the mp3's. Maybe her Ex helped her figure it out? Who cares? I drove off into the sunrise feeling melancholic but satisfied."

Aita for telling my daughter i love my wife and my other daughters more than her? ,5856,1g3jgnq,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1g3jgnq/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_i_love_my_wife_and/,1747,1728922033.0,"
Back when my youngest daughter Evelyn was 20 she ended up getting pregnant by her boyfriend Mike. Although it wasn‚Äôt how we wanted our grandchild to come into this world as she was still in school for medicine, we weren‚Äôt none the less happy about it.

She never expressed she wanted an abortion or wanted to  give him up for adoption. She went through the birth great.

Things started changed a couple months in she wasn‚Äôt interested in taking care of her son anymore left him to my wife and her sisters got hours on end. She stopped breastfeeding didn‚Äôt change him wheneve she was watching him and just stayed going out with Mike on dates they both pretended my grandson didn‚Äôt exists.

The final straw  was when Evelyn had a talk with my wife taht didn‚Äôt go so well. She first started how she never wanted to be a mom especially at such a young age. My wife told her too bad she‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt have unprotected sex if she didn‚Äôt want to be pregnant, she chose the do that so she has to take care of what she brought in this world. 

They started screaming at each other and Evelyn implied she would just leave and start over with  mike my wife told her if she left the baby she wouldn‚Äôt be her daughter anymore.

Evelyn left our house that same week, stopped answering calls and messages. She had abandoned my grandson, My wife and daughters just moved on quickly and filed the legal reports after a years my eldest Olga and her husband  adopted my grandson.

It‚Äôs been 15 years since Evelyn and my wife just doesn‚Äôt acknowledge her anymore there‚Äôs no picture of her in the house anymore and she‚Äôs practically a ghost in our house. No one speaks about  her and if they do it‚Äôs just for bad remarks.

Me and Evelyn relationship is different we sorta reconnected(my wife and daughters knows and they don‚Äôt really care as long as I don‚Äôt bring her around them). She finished her PhD got married to mike. She has her own practice and is doing well in life.

When we first started reconnecting she used to ask if my wife was curious about her which I didn‚Äôt lie and told her no. When she heard of my wife surgery she offered to pay but I told her we could afford it by ourselves and my wife would have refused her money either way. 

She hasn‚Äôt been invited to any baby shower birthdays celebration wedding parties anything.

Last night everything when downhill, she showed up at our house and my wife was the one to answer the door. She tried hugging her but my wife pushed her away and told her to get out. Evelyn broke down saying she was so lonely and just wanted forgiveness my wife told her she was forgiven but she wasn‚Äôt welcomed in her family. 

I told my wife fo let me handle it and she agreed and left upstairs, after comforting her I told her to leave since she was making my wife uneasy and it was the best if we kept our relationship separate I told her she knows how her mother and sister felt and I wasn‚Äôt going to allow her to ruin their sense of comfort. I told her to never overstep like that again or our relationship is done. 

She cried and asked me if she really didn‚Äôt matter to me anymore I told her she did but not more than them since they didn‚Äôt leave the moment things got too hard. She ended leaving in tears and just texted me to let me know she got home okay

Since then we haven‚Äôt spoken I feel like an ass but I feel like she overstepped everyone of not only my boundaries but my wife‚Äôs too. Still can‚Äôt help shaking if I‚Äôm wrong  aita?"

It was not spotty cell coverage for a phone going black for over 3 hours but he wouldn't even let me talk. Then he accused me of wanting to divorce him and making up stories so it appears it's his fault. Someone talked about DARVA on my last post and boy were they right! He is definitely turning the tables and deflects to me. I really need to find definitive proof to move forward. I am not going to find anything in his devices. There is nothing there. I even went to a subthread here on reddit called adultery (which made me physically sick, do not recommend) to read about all their tricks, but it didn't really help me find anything. IF you have any suggestions like recorders or trackers that I can use, please feel free to share. I could drive by his work and see if his car is there. I work from home, so.I have some flexibility but not too much. 

Yeah, if you told me a year ago that my husband would gaslight me this much, I never would have believed it.

This is a response/update to my previous post. I have to start a new one because my other post got locked. I think I got my answer. It's still not a smoking gun, but my husband went on a trip. This was a legitimate trip but today he said he was going to see a friend of his who lives in that area. So, out of curiosity I check his location and he had disabled it. I can tell because it's been over an hour and his phone is dark. I was livid he would do this. I waited and waited, his phone never came online, so I called him. Guess what he turned his phone off too. God knows what he is doing! I guess I need to find a divorce lawyer and get tested for STDs.

I do want to thank all of you kind people who responded. Your words and advice meant a lot to me. I had no-one else to talk to."

**Step 0**: Set Igni (from the Witcher collab) as a gesture, and one other quick gesture of your choice

**Step 1**: With your weapon out, use Igni

**Step 2**: Immediately use another gesture, cancelling out of Igni

That's it! Normally you cannot use a gesture with your weapon out, but igni puts your weapon away momentarily AND overrides that restriction. This is potentially a godsend for weapons with long resheathe animations like HBG.

I don't think there's any name for it among the Japanese hunting community yet, but I've unilaterally decided to call it the ""Igni Attack Gesture Cancel"" (IAGC) because it reminds me of a similar mechanic from another Capcom game."

Our directors (except SSR) don't know even the basics of CGI & VFX. (CG artist rant),107,1g46oka,tollywood,https://www.reddit.com/r/tollywood/comments/1g46oka/our_directors_except_ssr_dont_know_even_the/,30,1728995880.0,"I'm a software engineer who does 3D modelling and animation as a hobby. I want to use the VFX breakdown of Kalki 2989 AD as an example of how bad our directors are at shooting for CGI. The actual artists who worked on that movie did an incredible job despite that and hatsoff to them. You can watch the full VFX breakdown video [here](https://youtu.be/zQM3KZhjmDo?si=E-4K9KZI08lTNxEa).  
I decided to focus on Kalki because the CGI looks great, so I assumed Nag Ashwin shot in a CG friendly way. Nope, the CG artists essentially overwrote everything he shot in the climax with proper CGI, leaving only some snippets of actual footage. All the credit goes the the CG artists for the great climax, not the director.

&#x200B;

**1. Uneven bluescreens, with poor lighting or wrinkles, make keying out backgrounds a nightmare for roto artists.** This is the first thing I notice in every behind the scenes video and it makes me very upset. Instead of easily isolating actors, they have to manually trace around subjects frame by frame, adding hours of work. Color spill from improperly set up bluescreens further complicates this, requiring extra color correction and masking. Properly lit and positioned bluescreens can greatly streamline VFX, but directors often overlook these basics, making post-production unnecessarily difficult. This is reason greenscreens look bad in a lot of movies.

&#x200B;

[This is a good green screen. Its evenly lit and has no creases and folds.](https://preview.redd.it/neskaktqowud1.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e99f1369b6637dae48bd827c327bde2a86384fe)

[This is useless for the roto artists .](https://preview.redd.it/8ke6pv72pwud1.png?width=1716&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ff1060d9be498be612535384c3a6105cdf4aed6)

**2. Bad lighting during filming often forces CG artists to rebuild entire environments from scratch.** When on-set lighting is inconsistent or doesn‚Äôt match the intended CGI elements, it becomes nearly impossible to blend the real and digital seamlessly. This means instead of enhancing existing footage, artists must create fully digital environments just to fix lighting mismatches, which adds unnecessary workload and hampers the quality of the final result. Proper on-set lighting that considers the integration of CGI can save countless hours and lead to a more polished visual experience.

[Artists had to recreate this ship in CG](https://preview.redd.it/j20kd3x1vwud1.png?width=1687&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe5340cc442af2537fc05ee26b137441e6d95bf8)

[Notice the red lighting all over the ship.](https://preview.redd.it/nzv9uc65vwud1.png?width=1687&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fd982bd4c94e463269a84a4953a698688a99829)

**3. Bad wirework often forces CG artists to recreate entire digital doubles of actors**. When wire rigs are poorly set up or actors' movements look unnatural, the footage can't be easily used, and fixing it digitally is often not enough. As a result, artists have to fully recreate the actors in CGI just to correct awkward poses or unnatural physics. This not only adds a significant amount of work but also increases the risk of the CGI looking uncanny, detracting from the realism and immersion of the scene. Proper wirework coordination can help avoid these issues, saving time and improving quality. 

[Fully CG Prabhas in the climax.](https://preview.redd.it/ygtjiu36wwud1.png?width=1687&format=png&auto=webp&s=299bea595ec2b8fa6c2a007624a3857f974953e4)

**4. Due to poor planning, entire sets often need to be rebuilt in CG,** significantly complicating the production process. When directors fail to consider how scenes will be shot or how they‚Äôll integrate with CGI, it leads to inconsistencies in scale, detail, and lighting that are impossible to rectify in post-production. As a result, VFX teams must recreate complete environments digitally, which is both time-consuming and costly. This not only diverts resources away from other crucial aspects of production but also risks diminishing the overall quality of the film, highlighting the importance of thorough planning and coordination between directors and their VFX teams.

There are many more examples in that breakdown video and this isn't exclusive to Kalki. Kalki was able to overcome these issues because they had a lot of money and time. Because other movies don't have that much money and time, their CG looks bad. I wish our directors had VFX supervisors on set to learn how to properly shoot for CG. "

Something that hasn't been mentioned; Quad was Chovy's back up during DRX days and retired soon after.,328,1g457lf,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1g457lf/something_that_hasnt_been_mentioned_quad_was/,16,1728990938.0,"I think a lot of people including the people on the LCS desk do not really know about Quad and how insane his story is that he is now playing against Chovy in worlds quarterfinals. He retired from pro play in 2022, after only being a pro for 1 year and even during that year he was subbed off during summer for poor performance.

Just to set the stage CvMax after leaving GRF decided to come to DRX because he saw the talents in Keria and Quad who were already on DRX. Obviously in 2020, Chovy decided to join cvmax and quad had to be a sub but in 2021 after chovy left he was given the starting role for DRX. For people that didn't know, Quad was one of the most hyped prodigies that was talked about for years before he finally debuted. He changed his name from Quad => SOLKA and SOLCA both originating from ""Solo Cassiopeia""

2021 DRX had up and downs (mostly downs) and he was very poor in 2021 summer, losing lane in winning match ups and got subbed out. After the 2021 season, he retired from pro play.

2 years later He is playing in World quarterfinals against his friend, someone he backed up 4 years ago. 

If anyone had any reason to fail due to external circumstances it was Quad, but he unretired, moved across the globe, got thrown into a team mid-year that had a turmoil with their previous mid laner and is the last remaining mid laner in the LCS after gapping APA pretty hard at LCS finals and at worlds. 


I just wanted to write this post because I see so many excuses for players on why they aren't successful and how they need more time and you got someone like Quad, who never even got a full year as a starter, move across to a different continent and absolutely killed it."

Anyone else ever felt this way after losing a piggie?,323,1g419dp,guineapigs,https://i.redd.it/kothje7a4vud1.jpeg,23,1728972956.0,"I miss him so much. His name is Winnie and he passed over a year ago. He was my first guinea pig, and he was so sweet and affectionate. I‚Äôve struggled with my mental health over the years, and he‚Äôs always made me feel loved and less alone. I had even brought him to college with me as my emotional support animal.

Now that he‚Äôs gone, I have Ansel (who joined Winnie later on) and Teddy (who I got so Ansel wouldn‚Äôt be alone). They‚Äôre technically considered my emotional support animals now. Neither of them really likes being handled much though. Ansel tolerates it more, but Teddy is pretty skittish.

I‚Äôve been pretty depressed lately due to loneliness and ADHD-related challenges in school. Tonight, I broke down crying because of it all, and kept thinking about how alone I felt. And then I remembered that I have Ansel and Teddy‚Äîbut again, they‚Äôre not big on petting or cuddling. That led me to think about Winnie, and how he would lick me or lay on my chest and snuggle up to me. And so I cried harder, and more.

I love Ansel and Teddy. They‚Äôre my babies, and I go out of my way to spoil them. And I realize it‚Äôs not actually their responsibility to comfort me the way I want them to. But in moments like this, I can‚Äôt help comparing them to Winnie and wishing they were more affectionate."

I‚Äôll be sure to take pictures of the cute lil guy and post them for all of you. Thanks in advance to everyone that reached out to help send some bones to help cover the cost of the appointment / bills / vet drugs. I thought it would be kind of weird and slightly irresponsible to start the go fund me without knowing the exact cost of everything first so again (thanks to Chris and his partner) we are going to bill it to credit and worry about the cat crowd funding afterwards! 

I just wanted to say that Richmond is and has always been the greatest big little city ever for even the small things like this. <3 

After a bunch of meowing all around the neighborhood of fuzzy for 30 minutes last night ( he somehow knows fuzzy cactus is closed on Mondays ). He came right up and started insta purring. I took him to my house gave him a good meal and a million blankets and his down litter box. I don‚Äôt know if he knows what a vet is yet but afterwards I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be massively thankful.

Akash Maeen lived and worked in Hyderabad with his pregnant wife. A few days ago, he traveled to Mumbai, where his parents resided, to gift them a car.

The car delivery was delayed, and while returning from the showroom on his bike, with his wife as a pillion rider, his parents were in an auto ahead. Suddenly, another auto cut sharply in front of Akash, nearly causing him to fall. He honked and told the driver to be more careful.

The auto driver became enraged and started hurling abuses. A physical altercation ensued, and auto driver called his friends. Soon, 15-20 people began assaulting Akash. His wife, mother, and father, who rushed to help, were also injured. Tragically, his wife suffered a miscarriage, and Akash succumbed to his injuries.

Akash was not at fault, yet he paid with his life, the life of his unborn child, and left a family shattered forever.

We have a serious issue on our hands. We're living among zombies, goons, and criminals, who won't hesitate to kill over something as trivial as overtaking or honking. But for you, your life and your family‚Äôs safety should matter more than your ego. It‚Äôs not worth working hard, paying taxes, only to be lynched on the road for no reason. Your argument won't change their minds. On the road, keep calm. Don‚Äôt argue. Don‚Äôt react. Let it go.

This is called situational awareness, not cowardice. I‚Äôm not blaming Akash at all, he was right, but it‚Äôs better to be wrong and alive than right and dead."

I frequently use the spare room as an office, and also as a spare room for guests to stay temporarily. I‚Äôve never sublet the room, specifically I‚Äôve never been paid to let someone stay in the room, and I‚Äôve never let anyone stay indefinitely. My landlord is threatening to lock the room as they have ‚Äòevidence‚Äô to suggest that I‚Äôm subletting. The evidence they‚Äôve given is that the room looks like someone is living there permanently (they haven‚Äôt elaborated) and that there are multiple bikes outside. The bikes in question are me and my housemates, and the extra one is my old bike which someone stole the wheel and chain from, so I can‚Äôt use and haven‚Äôt sold. 

They‚Äôve said they‚Äôll monitor the situation via increased inspections and lock the rooms with 24r hours notice if they think I‚Äôm still subletting. I‚Äôve checked online and looked at housing laws and I can see anything to suggest that a landlord can restrict access to parts of the property due to suspicions, nor is there anything in my contract which gives them the right.

The day you have to relive will be chosen at random from one of the last 365 days you have lived. Each day you will wake up at the same time and feeling the same way you felt that day (sick/tired/hungover/etc.). You will be fully aware you are living the same day over and over but nobody else will know, and after the 365th time you wake up to the next day from the moment you took the offer and only you will be aware this time will have passed. 

You also have the choice to relive any number of randomly selected days, but that will divide the $1,000,000 by the number of days chosen and each day you will wake up to one of the random days. For example, you could choose 5 days and each morning you will wake up to one of 5 randomly selected days from the last year and at the end will receive $200,000. 

You can choose to live the days any way you like with a few caveats: 

- Nothing you do will have an effect outside of that day (i.e. no investing/betting to get rich)

- If you wake up on a day you would have to work, you must work that day or you will not receive the money (e.g. no calling in sick every day). This goes for all scheduled events. 

Would you accept, and if so, how many different days would you choose to relive?

Edit: if you die you die. Other bodily injuries will be cured the next day. 

Also, if you would take it, what‚Äôs the minimum you would do it for?"

Mortgage - ¬£1400
Home Insurance - 16
Car - 260
Car insurance - 27
Council Tax - 146
Heating - 130
Shopping, food, cleaning etc - ¬£350
Supplements and medication - ¬£90
TV, internet, licence etc - 80

Which is ¬£2500

So I am left with ¬£400 for all activities, holidays, repairs etc etc. I recently had to replace my boiler and it took me 3 months to cover the cost.

So I was looking at improving my salary and everything I earn above 44k is deduction 60% at source.

Student loan - 9%
Nic - 2%
Tax - 42%
Private Pension - 7%

So to get an extra ¬£500 a month and make my life easier I need to earn an extra 15k a year?? 55k to 70k? Which isn't going to be easy at all to do.

Just feeling a little desperate, I am working to survive.

For clarity, my House which is a massive mortgage is a 2 bed, end terrace very close to Glasgow centre, it's nothing spectacular by any means.

Any tips on how I get to a better position would be ideal."

I love vegetables, the nuances of spices, all the flavors there are beyond sweet, and the richness of allowing flavors to combine over time.

My spouse is not like that. Their mom cooked meat and warmed canned food up and called it dinner. They only use salt and pepper. Needless to say, my spouse hates my cooking and I‚Äôve resented it our entire marriage.

So we‚Äôre trying a compromise and they‚Äôre learning to cook. And ya‚Äôll. I can‚Äôt. 

To top it off I‚Äôm pregnant and I forced myself to eat this abomination. I can‚Äôt stomach leftovers, I really will hurl if I have to eat it again.

Final update: Goodbye to Our beloved Gino,90,1g474eb,Rottweiler,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g474eb,12,1728997209.0,"It is with the heaviest heart that I share the news that our sweet Gino passed away. On October 14th at 22:30, he crossed the rainbow bridge, surrounded by love. Gino fought bravely until his very last breath, showing the same strength and loyalty he always had for us.

Earlier that day, we visited him three times. In the morning, we encouraged him as he began to eat again, and his vitals were looking better, although the infection was still severe. In the afternoon, we even went to another hospital to collect plasma to boost his protein levels, hoping it would help him recover. We cuddled him and gave him all our love. But by the evening, we got the call that we feared‚Äîhis condition had worsened.

We rushed to the clinic and arrived at 22:20. Just ten minutes later, Gino peacefully passed away in our arms, surrounded by his favorite toys and the people who loved him most. He had fought for a week, but the infection had spread to his other organs.

Gino was only four years old, but he lived a beautiful life. He was the best dog we could have ever asked for‚Äîfull of love, loyalty, and joy. He never bit anyone, always listened, and was well-behaved even off-leash. The vets told us they had never met a Rottweiler like him.

He loved swimming, playing Frisbee, and especially his ball. He traveled with us by car to Slovakia twice, enjoying every moment of the journey. His spirit was full of adventure, but most of all, he loved being with us.

We are heartbroken, but we are grateful for the extra time we got to spend with him, thanks to the blood transfusion that gave us one more day together. We believe Gino held on just long enough to say goodbye to his family.

We also want to thank everyone who supported us through this incredibly difficult time. Your kindness, donations, and love helped us fight for Gino until the very end. The medical bills have reached around ‚Ç¨10,000, but we regret nothing. He was worth every effort, and we would do it all over again if we could.

Gino is now at peace, joining his friend Cujo, who has been waiting for him.

Thank you again, from the bottom of our hearts, for being there for us and for Gino.

With all our love and gratitude,
Gino‚Äôs family

And thank you for being the best boy ever."

I got down on one knee and proposed.

I told him I didn‚Äôt know he felt that way. I reminded him that we‚Äôve discussed the future, family, and so on, and this never came up before. I said I love that we‚Äôre different, and that I proposed because I see him as my natural family.

He said he needs time to think about it. It‚Äôs been frosty since. I know we're still together, but I‚Äôm heartbroken. I spoke to two friends about it, and they said that even if he says yes, those concerns are coming from distrust and it might not work out.

They have both become the most unbearable pickiest eaters on the planet and I'm so sick of their shit

At first I was able to make at least 10 different dishes out of their picky eating habits, so i'd rotate those out. Over these last few years they have both gotten worse with their picky eating to the point where there's only like 3 different dishes they will eat that I cook.

I cook really good, I am spanish and my mother taught me how to make so many different cultural dishes as well as ""Americanized"" dishes. My husband is American italian, he won't eat anything that isnt American/italian but hes even pickier than that. To give you an example he will only eat white meat chicken that isn't touching any bone, he will never touch seafood...he told me that he used to be the person that would only order chicken fingers at a restaurant so im married to the adult version of that kid. My son has recently started following in his image. My son used to have a wide palette and would try anything but not anymore, all of a sudden he cant handle anything just like my husband (they arent even blood related, my husband is stepfather)

They used to loved my dishes and I used to get a lot of praise for how good my cooking was Im not sure why over time they have become the pickiest eaters!

Now all i get is ""im not hungry right now i'll eat later"" and then they dont touch the food and it goes to waste.  Or straight up ""i'm not eating that"" when it is perfectly delicious and edible.

Im so sick of the two of them that I have refused to cook for a couple months now and my husband brought it up like it was a problem that im not making any of the 3 damn boring ass dishes he can handle. I'm sick of cooking these 3 dishes, and sometimes they wont even eat that!!

They've been fending for themselves for dinner and I feel way less stressed out now. And just so you know I work full time just like my husband does so why he can't do the cooking if he wants to be so picky I don't understand, apparently because I have the vagina I'm the one expected to cook, over it! I come home from work ready to eat dinner but will he cook it, no? So Ive been having to just have a ""girl dinner"" by myself which usually consists of cheese and crackers.

I think im just ranting at this point, I wish someone else would mind dinner and I didnt have to be responsible anymore, anyway do you think im an asshole?"

I guess I‚Äôm just feeling pretty depressed and anxious, and being on the last straw with family hurts. Anyways, thank all of you for so much love and support always. I know I can come here for support instead of being turned away and shunned when I need help.

They'll get the message without an awkward (and frankly presumptuous-you're not dating!) conversation .

ETA: I probably should've clarified I meant more of a fade out than a true ghost. If someone's done something specific a discussion is warranted but I think for a vibe mismatch the ""we don't connect anymore"" comes off more condescending than comforting. Just my two cents. "

My daughter had been traumatized for two years. Apparently it's all coming together now.,475,1g3y4ew,shortscarystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1g3y4ew/my_daughter_had_been_traumatized_for_two_years/,14,1728961300.0,"‚ÄúSherry, dear, are you alright? I heard about what happened!‚Äù

I had my nine-year old daughter sitting down on the recliner in our small living room. Her small, skittish eyes stared at my own.

I tried to remain calm. There must have been just as many thoughts running through her young mind as there were going through my own.

When she was seven, her father, Norman, had snapped. He had always been stressed, but he never said why. Not even to me. I had tried to help him, but he never opened up.

So when he ran out that night and dismembered three of our neighbors, along with our family dog, it almost broke me. He was stopped and arrested, but the damage was done. I couldn‚Äôt stop crying and shaking, but my Sherry got it worse.

She was the one who first found Bolt‚Äôs limbless corpse, lying in his doghouse, his bloodied and mutilated corpse plastered against the back wall.

After that, she lost the sparkle in her eyes, and she stopped smiling. It broke my heart worse than what *he* did.

So, when I heard that someone had cut off the arms and legs of one of Sherry‚Äôs classmates outside of school hours, I was terrified of what she would do and think.

And her somber silence that afternoon *was* terrifying.

I tried to talk to her more, but she was silent. She wouldn‚Äôt even move off the chair. Thankfully, her sleepiness eventually won over and she fell asleep. I exhaled and picked her up, bringing her to her bed.

The following morning, I woke her up later than usual. I figured she wouldn't be going to school.

I opened the door, but it was stopped by something heavy. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come in mama, it‚Äôs all coming together.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs coming together dear? Are you alright?‚Äù I replied, trying to see through the slim crack of the door.

‚ÄúYes mama, it‚Äôs all coming together.‚Äù¬†

Something about the emptiness of her voice sent a shiver through my spine. I pushed harder.

‚ÄúSherry, could you open the door sweetie? I need to come in.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNo mama, it‚Äôs all coming together.‚Äù

I suddenly grew frantic and began to push forcefully, trying to push past the block. It moved a ways, and I peered into the room, my stomach plummeting as I did.

Crude sigils and symbols were scrawled along the walls in blood, and the room was a mess.

And at the foot of her disordered bed, surrounded by a puddle of blood and sigils, Sherry sat holding something in her hands.

‚ÄúSHERRY WHAT IS-‚Äù I screamed in horror, but was interrupted by her calm and empty voice.

Turning around to show me the body of Bolt in her arms, she smiled a shaky and frenzied smile. Human arms and legs were sewn onto the stumps where the limbs had been cut off.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all coming together mama. Bolt is coming back together.‚Äù"

But Overload team of Raiden-Che-Fischl-Bennet always worked. I couldn't just take Fischl out of my Team 1 though, for the lack of good continuous Electro character. The while playing IT, I had to get my Kuki to level 70. It got me curious. I read about it and realised I don't actually need to develop her lot for Hyperbloom to work! Just EM on her artifacts and as much as I can get. So I added whatever I had. And whoa! Seriously, I was stunned. Nahida-Kuki-Nuvi-Xiangling just worked! Nahida has 1012 em and Kuki I was abel to get 868 EM! Amd my other team Overload - Raiden-Che-Fischl-Bennet with so much ER , and right timings they just keep doing Elemental Burst in rotation continuously! It made getting 36 star easily!

TIFU telling a joke at the end of a job interview ,2999,1g3kvwn,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1g3kvwn/tifu_telling_a_joke_at_the_end_of_a_job_interview/,265,1728925522.0,"Happened like 6 years ago but still haunts me today. Wasn‚Äôt thrilled with my current job and was looking for opportunities. MIL had a friend who was a long time secretary/office manager for the owner of a small but very successful commercial copier/printer company. They had an opening in management that would have been a dream for me at the time. She was able to get me an interview immediately with the owner. 

Always hated job interviews. Get more nervous for those than literally anything. Pair that with how much I wanted this gig‚Ä¶ I was a mess going in. 

Show up the day of. Meet the owner and I‚Äôm 1 on 1 with him in his office. Guys mid 50s, easy to talk to, cool dude. Interview is super relaxed, he‚Äôs laughing telling examples of things, even light heartedly cursing a couple times. I‚Äôm still nervous on edge, but got more comfortable as it went on. 

Thing was doing great, seemed like I was nailing it, then towards the end he says ‚ÄòI ask this of everyone I interview, what‚Äôs your go to ice breaker joke?‚Äô I still distinctly remember my rear end legitimately puckering up. I froze. Mind went blank. I don‚Äôt really tell jokes. I don‚Äôt really know any, and certainly don‚Äôt have a go to one. I actually think I was about to faint or pass out, when I suddenly remembered the joke my wife‚Äôs friend told us just the past weekend‚Ä¶.

‚Ä¶.now I preface this by saying my wife‚Äôs friend ‚ÄòJackie‚Äô is super nice, but very inappropriate pretty much all the time. Curses constantly, no shame with sex talk or jokes. We were walking with a small group into an MLB game once and as she walked passed a guy she found attractive she loudly declared ‚ÄòGod Damn I would drain his ballsack‚Äô. Just one of dozens of one liners she‚Äôs dropped. 

So we saw her at a kids bday party of all places a few days prior, and she greets us with this calamity of a joke‚Ä¶. 

‚ÄòWhat is another term for ejaculating in a woman? LOADING THE DISHWASHER‚Äô. 

Wife and I just scoffed a bit, shook our heads, said hi and moved on. 

Back to the interview‚Ä¶ you guessed it. Sure enough in my panic, frozen state, feeling dizzy and potentially close to fainting, my mind identified that moment and that ‚Äòjoke‚Äô, and it just came out. The mix of my hysteria with the relaxed vibes the owner was giving out apparently gave my brain the idea that telling this joke was the move. I never talk like that. Like ever. It must have been just a last grasp of my subconscious to fill his request. 

He stared at me for a few seconds. Had a look like a mix of astonishment and disgust. Finally just said ‚Äòok then, well thanks for coming in‚Äô. Stood up, shook my hand and opened the door for me. I walked out and the door shut right behind me. I just kept walking, through the rest of the office and out the front door straight to my car, got in, immediately pulled out and got out of there. I stopped at a convenience store a few minutes down the road, parked and just sat there, incredulous. 

Not only did I not get the job, which based on the interview up until that point I likely had a great chance at getting, but also I had to face my MIL, who obviously was told by her friend what happened. Wasn‚Äôt exactly my finest moment.  

TL;DR - was nailing an interview for a dream job, then I froze, and in a panic told an absurdly inappropriate joke I heard the previous weekend leaving everyone in a state of horror and disgust. "

Megv√°ltotta online az 1235 forintos menetjegy√©t, √©s 20:27-kor felsz√°llt a M√ÅV 4921-es sz√°m√∫ j√°rat√°ra Kelenf√∂ld fel√©. M√°r itt sokaknak meglep≈ë lehet a t√∂rt√©net, hiszen l√©nyegesebb k√©s√©s n√©lk√ºl indult a vonat, de nem itt lesz √©rdekes ez a t√∂rt√©net.

A szerelv√©ny egyik meg√°ll√≥ja Bicsk√©n volt, itt teh√°t le is lass√≠tott a vonat, majd meg√°llt. A magyar utasok hozz√°szoktak, hogy vannak olyan forgalmi okok, amelyek miatt a sz√ºks√©gesn√©l valamivel t√∂bb id≈ët t√∂lt egy vonat egy √°llom√°son, √≠gy az els≈ë 10 perc v√°rakoz√°s ut√°n m√©g nem t≈±nt fel senkinek, hogy komolyabb probl√©ma lenne, azonban ahogy teltek a percek, az utasok ‚Äì √©s √≠gy olvas√≥nk is ‚Äì egyre t√ºrelmetlenebbek lettek. Egy id≈ë ut√°n azt√°n felt≈±nt olvas√≥nk kocsij√°ban a kalauz, aki, mint kider√ºlt, v√©gigj√°rta a vagonokat, √©s minden utast t√°j√©koztatott arr√≥l, hogy nem forgalmi vagy technikai okokb√≥l √°ll a j√°rat.

Bicsk√©n√©l kisz√°llt a mozdonyvezet≈ë, mert lej√°rt a munkaideje.

A meglep≈ë inform√°ci√≥ ut√°n a legt√∂bb utas, √≠gy olvas√≥nk is √∫gy d√∂nt√∂tt, hogy ink√°bb lesz√°ll a j√°rm≈±r≈ël, hogy megv√°rja az egy √≥r√°val k√©s≈ëbbi j√°ratot, √≠gy v√©g√ºl 21:30 helyett 22:30-kor √©rkezett meg Budapestre. Ut√≥lag kider√ºlt az is, hogy ≈ëk j√°rtak jobban, ugyanis az eredeti, 4921-es sz√°m√∫ j√°rat csak a k√∂vetkez≈ë vonat ut√°n 10 perccel tudott elindulni, ugyanis akkor √©rt oda a m√°sik mozdonyvezet≈ë, aki lev√°ltotta a j√°rm≈±b≈ël kisz√°ll√≥ koll√©g√°j√°t.""

It's still sinking in but yesterday I weighed myself and I've officially made my goal weight of 127! I took my first shot Jan 15th of this year and now I'm ready to start talking maintenence with my doc. I chose 127 because that was the last weight I had been comfortable with. It is at the top of my healthy weight range so I could lose another 5 pounds if I wanted but I'm guessing I might anyway in the process of figuring out maintenence. My app is showing green for everything! My weight and body comp are healthy. I can't wait to see my A1C. When I started, my A1C was 6.2. I just can't believe I'm in the 20s. It was a tough journey with lots of side effects but worth every moment of nausea and heart burn. ‚ù§Ô∏è "

Next, and finally: What is the overall best/funniest quote or moment from Best of the Worst? You can choose one of the quotes that is on the quote board already, but this is also an opportunity to bring up a moment you feel didn't get enough attention or didn't fit into any of the other categories. Does this [make all of the previous rounds a total waste](https://youtu.be/a3CZs75sSkM?t=97)? Arguably, but I think most of the fun in these threads has been looking and the comments and being reminded of my favourite moments from Best of the Worst. In a way, the REAL best moment is the friends we made along the way. But in another, more accurate way, the best moment is whatever gets the most votes.

**Leave a comment with your favourite quote from the given panelist, and after at least 24 hours and when the voting slows down, whichever quote has the most upvotes is added to the wall of quotes.**

So, make sure you check the comments before posting your own suggestion - if there are multiple comments with the same quote, that could end up splitting the vote.

I‚Äôve put the panelists in alphabetical order by last name. In addition to the panelists, I have added categories at the end for Best Joke Made in Editing, Best Collective Quote, and Best Quote Overall.

If you really hate this kind of thing, I encourage you to leave a bunch of angry and insulting comments directed towards me ‚Äì it boosts post visibility."

There is one homeopathic Doctor practising in Wakad and Baner Area by the name Anshita Singh Rathore. please avoid her. Because Of the below reasons:
1) Appointments are just namesake, She never adheres to the time. 10 o clock se appointment leti hain but walks in at 11:30 when the clinic is full. We keep on asking doctor kidhar... You can read about it on Google reviews. 
2)Charges for follow up keep on changing all the time, kabhi 15 days kabhi 3 weeks kabhi month ke baad. So much of confusion and we cant ask her anything. 
3) not all illnesses are cured by Homeopathy, but this DF will insist to continue her medicines only even when the situation gets worse after having her medicines. Acceptance nahi hain. 
4) For PCOD, PCOS, Hormonal Disorders customers, the moment she discovers that you're almost cured, kuch aisa medicine de degi ki aap wapas 0 zero pe aajao. Basically she wants to keep minting money from your illnesses and not cure you. 
5) Hormonal problems jinko hain, unko har choti cheez k liye she'll insist to take medicines only and only from her. And jab tak 4 chakkar kaatenge nahi tab tak you won't get better at all. And in between if you go to another doctor, she'll start taunting you agressively about it and almost deny to give her diagnosis citing ab mei kuch nhi kar skti. Go to that doctor only... 
6) God Forbid, if anyone leaves a negative review, She first does character assassination and shows how she's right and condescending remarks and threatens them with Legal action if the client doens't take down the negative reviews. 

She's a doctor who just wants to make money and has no empathy to the patients. 
The longer you come, the longer she makes money. So avoid. "

I was married to my wife for 4 years and have a 3 year old daughter with her. My wife passed 2 years ago. I still consider everyone on her side of the family as my in-laws and always will. 

Since her passing, everyone on both sides of the family have been extremely helpful in raising my daughter so I can continue to work and provide for her. They jump in to babysit while I'm working, taking her to park when I'm preparing food, playing tea party with her, etc. This goes double for my sister-in-law (27F), Kayla. 

Kayla basically moved into my home and helped with my daughter in every way while she wasn't at work. For a short period in the last 8 months, she moves back to her parents place while I was dating someone else, but began to take an active role with my daughter again once that relationship ended 3 months ago. She hasn't moved back in, opting to live with her parents still, but she has brought it up as an option since my home is closer to her work than her parent's place. 

Last week, to alleviate from the stress of a legal issue, I took my daughter, my parents, and in-laws on a 5 days long cruise, Kayla of course was invited too and did join us. On the last day, my In-laws told me they wanted to spend the day with my daughter so I could have some time to enjoy the more adult oriented activities. Kayla joined me for the full day. Through the day, she made comments about it being a fun date and then laughed it off. I didn't take that too seriously due to the laugh after. We shared a slow dance post dinner. 

At the end of the day when I escorted her back to her room, she kissed me very deeply, and told me ""I'd like to go on an actual date with you when we're back. I already talked to my parents and they support. I don't want an answer now, I know how you like to deliberate. Think about it for a couple days."" and she headed in. 

Kayla is an attractive woman for sure, and we get along very well. There is no awkwardness in our interactions even after that day when she's over almost daily. We've known each other for 7 years, and gotten to know the mannerisms of each other pretty deeply over the last 2 years. I have almost no doubts that the date would go well given the last day of the cruise. 

But at the same time, she's my sister-in-law. And it feels odd to consider it. I could really use some advice if anyone has had similar experience. Thanks.

I always figured I'd post when I finished the ""next couple things on my list"" but after doing this for several years I am realizing the list never stops growing/changing lol.

**Background**
I think I started in 2019 with a raspi for homeassistant so I could move my smart lights off of Alexa. HomeAssistant has this cool feature that automatically discovers things on your network to integrate and it also offers a bunch of Add-Ons for popular services. From there I think it's a slippery slope to homelab.  
I've run proxmox and *Sense on various hardware since, including an Optiplex FX160, Optiplex 7010 SFF, and a Dell R710. I recently upgraded the R710 to an R730 mostly because I wanted AVX support for LLM stuff, which prompted me to go a bit buckwild and upgrade some other stuff to 10gbe and rack it.

**Equipment**
* Hasivo S600WP-4GT-2SX-SE
* Generic PassThrough 24 port patch panel
* Brocade ICX 7250-48P
* ShoreTel branded supermicro server (Xeon E3-1240v6, 2x 128GB Raid 1, 16GB RAM, X710-DA4 10gbe 4 port SFP+ NIC)
* Optiplex 7010 LFF (X710-DA2 10gbe 2 port SFP+ NIC)
* Dell R730 (Dual Xeon e5-2690v6, 128gb RAM, 8x 4TB Raidz2, 2X 500GB SSD Raid1, 2x 1tb nvme Raid1, Tesla P40)
* CyberPower PR1500LCDRT2U

**Not Pictured**
* WAS-110
* Netgear WAX 630E AP
* TP-Link AX1500 AP
* Optiplex FX160
* Optiplex 7010 SFF
* Dell R710
* 3D printer with raspi

Hasivo: necessary for the WAX630E for 2.5GB and PoE++ (802.3BT).  

Brocade: I admit it's too much for my needs. The 8x SFP+ was appealing for me but I clearly don't need 48 ports. I am not sure what I'm gonna do here. I obviously use the SFP's. My thought is to eventually get a standalone SFP+ switch and a smaller rj45 switch that supports 2.5gbe and 802.3bt so I can get rid of the Hasivo.  

ShorTel: the branding is goofy, but it's really just a supermicro server. It's currently running OPNsense. Definitely overkill (seems to be my theme). I do have OPNsense packed full of software like Suricata, ZenArmor, Crowdec, HAProxy, various other services and several VLANs and WireGuard tunnels. I've only seen it get up to 40% CPU usage and that is rare.  

Optiplex 7010: Only running Proxmox backup server with a single 8tb WD red and 2x 128gb SSD raid 1 boot drive.  I plan to move that to a different box but I am not sure what yet. Maybe the R710 but I will want to configure some sort of script to keep that powered off the majority of the time.  

R730 is the main server running most of my crap, I'll outline below. 

UPS: Haven't gotten it to work yet. Maybe the batteries. It won't power on most of the time. I thought it would work only on AC power even if the batteries are dead so IDK. I've gotten it to power on twice, and both times everything seemed normal, battery health came back fine, but randomely in the middle of the night it starts beeping really loud and shuts off. Hope I get it figured out because we have occasional power blips here.  

WAS110 - SFP for bypassing the ATT residential gateway.  

Netgear WAX630E: my main AP that has a few SSIDs for various VLANs.  

TP-Link AP: AP for the tenant that lives in the apartment in my basement on their own VLAN so they don't have to deal with my crap.  

Optiplex FX160: Formerly ran pfsense. Now it's repurposed as a general debian box in my living room. Runs some voice assistant software and the remote ZigBee coordinator for ZHA in HomeAssistant.

Optiplex 7010 SFF: decommissioned. Might sell.  

Dell R710: Decommissioned. Might sell, might turn into PBS and replace the Optiplex 7010 LFF.  

3D printer: Occasionally in a working state lol.

**Services**
* HomeAssistant
* Mopidy/Snapcast for music streaming throughout house
* Voice recognition (Whisper/Piper) server utilizing GPU
* Keycloak for SSO
* Syslog server with grafana/Loki/influxdb
* Nextcloud & Collabora -  lots of bells and whistles, user GPU for recognition
* Navidrome
* AudioBookshelf
* Matrix Server with some bridges and Jitsi
* Lemmy server
* Jellyfin using GPU
* arr-stack using [arr-scripts](https://github.com/RandomNinjaAtk/arr-scripts)
* [Slskd](https://github.com/slskd/slskd/releases)
* Qbittorrent and nzbget
* an NVIDIA license server for use with [vGPU-Unlock-Patcher](https://github.com/VGPU-Community-Drivers/vGPU-Unlock-patcher)
* stable-diffusion and ollama
* MacOS VM

Not really sure what's next software wise. I've been really enjoying playing with OPNsense and the network related stuff. AI has been fun to mess with as well."

I've always wanted to watch LOTR but never found the motivation to do so. After seeing bits of ROP, I finally convinced myself that I need to watch them. 

Just finished binging through all the extended editions of LOTR and The Hobbit movies and I just gotta say that I can't believe I never watched these masterpieces before. Some of the best 20+ hours of media I've consumed in a long while. After decades, I can now finally understand all the memes, references, and conversations I've missed! Finished S2 of ROP and then went and watched all of S1. I can't wait for the next season! Hopefully, it won't take another 2 years however. 

Totally still in a Middle-Earth ""high"" right now, so in the meantime I've also been deep diving into the lore and Silmarillion, listening, playing, and relistening to the brilliant Howard Shore and Bear McCreary scores, reading a ton, and I'm enjoying every bit of it! I feel like I picked a great time to jump into the universe as well due to not only ROP, but also the announcements of new movies coming out and in production like the Gollum movie and the Rohirrim movie! Anyways, just wanted to share my excitement and experience with entering this universe for the first time due to this show."

Prediction: Return to Tarkir will let you ride dragons,162,1g42ner,magicTCG,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1g42ner/prediction_return_to_tarkir_will_let_you_ride/,41,1728979451.0,"In Mark Rosewater's recent Drive to Work podcast episode, he discusses the purpose of the cardcrafting meeting within Wizards (a technical meeting to figure out mechanical problems with cards/sets). As an example of the things they look at, he mentions that Outlaws of Thunder Junction and a future upcoming set were both designing a way to ride creatures, but implemented it differently; Thunder Junction was doing a mutate variant where the creatures are placed on each other, whereas the future set was doing a riff on vehicles. Mark mentions both sets will be in Standard together, so they probably don't want to be implementing the same idea two different ways, and considered both options before deciding the vehicles-riff would be better, making it into Thunder Junction as the saddle mechanic.

If Thunder Junction's going to be in Standard with this upcoming saddle-mechanic set, the only options are:

- Death Race

- Tarkir

- Sci-Fi / Space Opera

- Lorwyn

- Strixhaven

- Event finale set

So my guess is: Return to Tarkir will let you saddle dragons, maybe as the Mardu mechanic.

Of course it could be pretty much any of these! Maybe some of the death race participants ride creatures like vehicles. Maybe the sci-fi set use rideable creatures to move around. Feel free to speculate :D"

I've always wanted to watch LOTR but never found the motivation to do so. After seeing bits of ROP, I finally convinced myself that I need to watch them. 

Just finished binging through all the extended editions of LOTR and The Hobbit movies and I just gotta say that I can't believe I never watched these masterpieces before. Some of the best 20+ hours of media I've consumed in a long while. After decades, I can now finally understand all the memes, references, and conversations I've missed! Finished S2 of ROP and then went and watched all of S1. I can't wait for the next season! Hopefully, it won't take another 2 years however. 

Totally still in a Middle-Earth ""high"" right now, so in the meantime I've also been deep diving into the lore and Silmarillion, listening, playing, and relistening to the brilliant Howard Shore and Bear McCreary scores, reading a ton, and I'm enjoying every bit of it! I feel like I picked a great time to jump into the universe as well due to not only ROP, but also the announcements of new movies coming out and in production like the Gollum movie and the Rohirrim movie! Anyways, just wanted to share my excitement and experience with entering this universe for the first time due to this show."

[Question] How do people even buy a Rolex and is this a common experience in their boutique? ,195,1g41txo,Watches,https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1g41txo/question_how_do_people_even_buy_a_rolex_and_is/,160,1728975520.0,"I‚Äôve been into watches for a while now and have always wanted a sports Rolex, specifically the Panda Daytona. But between the ridiculous grey market prices that I can't afford and the notoriously long waiting lists, I had almost given up on the idea.

Recently, I heard that sports Rolex models were becoming more available at boutiques due to a drop in grey market prices. I figured it might be worth trying my luck, so I looked up the nearest boutique. Where I live, Rolex boutiques require appointments and no walk ins allowed, so I booked one, expecting at least a decent conversation about the watches and my interest in the brand.

The day arrived, and here‚Äôs how it went:

Me: Hi, I‚Äôm here for an appointment with S.

S: Hello, how can I help you today? Is there a specific model you're interested in?

Me: I‚Äôm interested in the white Daytona and the Sky Dweller in blue.

S: Those models aren‚Äôt currently available in stock or for display.

Me: Okay.

S: If you‚Äôd like to join the waiting list, I can sign you up, but we don‚Äôt have an ETA for these models.

Me: Understood. Is there any other sports model I could try?

S: Not at the moment, sir.

I filled out a form, knowing full well it probably won‚Äôt lead anywhere, and left.

The entire appointment took less than five minutes. And an appointment was required just for this? The staff wasn‚Äôt rude by any means, but the interaction felt robotic. I came in hoping to at least engage in some kind of casual conversation about watches, but I left feeling like I had just gone through the motions.

it makes me wonder how do people actually manage to buy one, or even have the patience to keep trying?

I'll probably not getting a Rolex in my collection any day soon as i can't afford grey and can't see any direction getting 1 from boutique.

In contrast, APs are just as notorious for their long waits and low availability, but at least their staff will sit down with you, have a genuine conversation, and explain the realistic chances of getting something like a Royal Oak. When I visited a JLC boutique, the staff took the time to show me various collections, including pieces I could never afford, like the Gyrotourbillon. They shared insights about their heritage, the movements used in each model, and I actually felt good about putting myself on a waitlist for one of their pieces."

They are constantly weary, trudging through forests, hungry and barely by luck finding their next meal to replenish. 

In Hobbit they pretty much got lucky getting kidnapped by the Trolls as thats actually how they replenished their food and also got their only weapons until they reached the mountain. Not to mention running into Beorn, and later the wood elves and Lake town residents who also feed and replenish their supplies. 

In Fellowship book one they are constantly hungry, aided by the Hobbits voracious appetite, and barely by luck running into people who lend them a hand and feed them and take care of them, Gildor Inglorion, Old Maggot, Tom Bombadil etc. 

Forget the orcs, food supply was the main villain. Imagine traveling across America or Europe on foot with no credit card and just a couple bucks in your pocket and maybe a few pop tarts. 

Starving plus fighting off orcs, smeagol, Shelob, balrog. Wow. Kudos to the fellowship!!! "

Ren√©e Slegers: our interim coach,105,1g44cqb,ArsenalWFC,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g44cqb,21,1728987533.0,"I wanted to put some information about her together so that we can have some idea what to expect from her, and hopefully get excited for what‚Äôs to come.

She‚Äôs 35 years old, has played football for clubs in the Netherlands and Sweden and got 55 caps for the Dutch team. She had to go into early retirement because of multiple injuries, and unfortunately had to miss the 2017 Euros win due to knee injury as well. She officially retired in early 2018.

Fun fact: she has played in the Arsenal Academy when she was 17 years old, so there‚Äôs quite some history there. During her time with us, Kelly Smith was her assistant coach and Alex Scott was her teacher in sports psychology.

She has coached various teams, from U19 to head coach at IF Limhamn Bunkeflo, head coach to Sweden‚Äôs U23 national team, Rosengard‚Äôs B team and succeeding Jonas as first team coach in June 2021. They won 2 league titles, but she got fired early in her third season.

Her role at Arsenal ‚Äî as far as we know ‚Äî was mostly in individual player development. You can see her at every game, talking to the player that‚Äôs about to be subbed on and giving some last minute strategies and tips.

Lotte talked about the work she and Ren√©e have done together that helped her have such a good season last year: ‚ÄúWith the help of Slegers, Wubben-Moy has developed key technical areas in her game such as her body positioning, her ability to break the press with her passing and being more aggressive.
She talked them through with Slegers and the assistant coach came up with training drills to put it into practise.‚Äù (BBC Sport) 

Frida talked about her in one of the match programme articles: ‚ÄúI always try to develop myself but if I can see that there are more areas to develop, I can speak to different coaches and they‚Äôre all good at certain things. For example, Ren√©e Slegers, she‚Äôs played as a 10 herself so I know that she knows that role in and out, so it makes me want to ask questions about that.‚Äù

So, let‚Äôs see what she can do with our team. All we can do now is put our full support behind her, and give her the time to figure things out. And for all the non Dutchies, good luck pronouncing her name. I‚Äôm gonna enjoy listening to commentators doing it completely wrong."

His statements come amid the release of 50 pages of Air Force records related to provocative 'drone' incursions, that one general calls 'Close Encounters at Langley.'

For at least 17 nights last December, swarms of noisy, small UFOs were seen at dusk 'moving at rapid speeds' and displaying 'flashing red, green, and white lights' penetrating the highly restricted airspace above Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.

**AITA for breaking up with my fianc√©e for telling her best friend she was not engaged?**

&#x200B;

My now ex-fianc√©e (30F) and me (M27) got engaged 3 weeks ago. We've been dating for 5 years and I finally got the money to give her the wedding she wanted. Well, 3 days ago we were discussing our guest list, and I asked if she wanted to invite her best friend, let's call him James (M30). James lives in another state, but since they were friends for 10 years, I thought I could even pay for his travel expenses since it would be great to have her best friend at the wedding.

She denied, saying that it would take a lot of work to bring him, and she wanted to be a ""family"" event. Countless times she mentioned that James was like family to her, so I insisted, she got annoyed and said ""I didn't even told him we were engaged"". That took me by surprise, I tried to ask why, but she started stonewalling me, and I left her alone. After a couple of hours, I tried to ask her again why she haven't told him we were engaged, and she still refused to tell me, and I admit, my insecurity got the better of me.

In the past, James had confessed he had feelings for her, which she turned down and basically friendzoned him. But by the way she told me, it always sounded like she had him as a backup, something not only me, but her exes realized. She ""married"" him online, they always made they WoW characters look like a couple (like wearing the same transmog and shit like that), when she had a fight with her exes, he was ""always there for her"" and etc.

I told her that made me uncomfortable and if she was not planning to tell him, she might as well consider herself single, cause I would not marry someone who couldn't be honest. Yes, I was pretty immature, but she did something even more immature, she texted him while showing me her phone something like ""hey, just so you know, I was engaged, but not anymore"" and send it to him. I told her to pack her things and leave my house.

Ever since she left, she has been calling me, but I refused to answer. My mom called me (because she apparently called my mom), and said that I was an asshole for ending things for such a ""ridiculous"" thing.

So, AITA?

Edit: sorry for the typo in the title

Edit 2: hey guys, I made some dinner and I think I'm gonna go with u/DoneOver69Position (cool username btw). I'm gonna ask her to meet up and ask to see their messages. And to u/FoxySlyOldStoatyFox, I'm already low contact with my mom, but I'm going to make my decisions after I clear everything up. So I'm kinda promising an update.

**Miserable-Most-1265**

*NTA, there is a reason she won't tell her ""best friend"" that she plans on getting married. I mean most women think getting married is one of the biggest things in life, and tells everyone she knows. Unless it will put a damper of something. You know boyfriends hate hearing their girlfriend is getting married*

&#x200B;

**Wise\_Focus\_309**

*The night I proposed, I am pretty sure that my wife was on the phone before I even heard a ""yes"" with as many people as she could think to call!*

&#x200B;

**rangebob**

*haha right ? mine was still naked when she started calling people*

&#x200B;

**Ok-Ad3906**

*Lol my husband and I had been to a friend's wedding earlier that day.*

*Lying in bed watching TV later, he said ""We should get married.""*

*He'd mentioned it before (but 'reneged') so I was like, ""(Yeah right) OK, sure.""*

*He said, ""I'm going to call my mom.""*

*I realized he was 100% serious this time. (He's NOT a 'mama's boy', but that's how I knew he meant it, lmao).*

*I waited until he called her and put her on speakerphone and THEN I called people, lol.*

*14 years together and 10 married, one child. So I get it!*

&#x200B;

**DoneOver69Position**

*So your ex fiancee didn't want to tell her boyfriend about you. Unless you poly sounds like a great reason to end an engagement.*

*If you want to confirm that she was cheating, offer to meet up with her for lunch. When you get there, tell her if she wants any chance with you she needs to unlock her phone, and you read all of her messages between him and her on all media. I'm sure you will find more than enough to confirm that leaving is the best choice.*

**siren2040**

*.... Even in a poly relationship that's still messed up, lying, and cheating. Polyamory requires honesty and transparency on each of the relationships*

**DoneOver69Position**

*Poly allows you to make rules based off of how you and your partner agree. I have known a couple of people who have had successful don't ask don't tell polyamorous relationships. That is their choice and how they choose to be. That is the only time I could figure out how this could possibly be okay. That is why I put that exception. But some people who are poly don't accept don't ask don't tell us a viable relationship, and to that I say allow people to make their own choices on how they choose to be in a relationship the same way you would like people to allow you to choose. Personally with my 16 years experience with polyamory, I prefer kitchen table poly, but I also accept that people have different things that work for them.*

&#x200B;

**FoxySlyOldStoatyFox**

*You‚Äôve done well to get rid of one woman who claims to love you but fundamentally doesn‚Äôt respect you and believes you should be eat shit in your relationships.*

*Sadly, you‚Äôve still got another woman who fits that description - your mother - and it‚Äôll be trickier to get rid of her.*

**Update - 1 days later**

&#x200B;

Hey guys, I just got home after talking to my (still) ex-fiancee, and since a lot of people asked for an update, here it is. But, I want to clarify a few things.

As commented on my original post, I pay for the house since I bought it before dating her and I asked her to move in, since it was close to her job. I work from home since I'm in tech, but she had to go to work, that's why I paid for her car, to help her commute (and honestly her salary is shit). I was her partner, so I didn't see any problem with that. I thought she was the one, despite everything, she is smart, funny, we had chemistry, but I felt betrayed.

To the update.

We met at a coffee shop on the premise we would discuss how to save our relationship, at least, that's what she thought. As soon as we sat down, I asked to see their messages. She got defensive immediately and told me she had deleted everything. I asked to see her phone anyway. She started to cry, ugly cry, asking me to stop. At that point I had already decided I was not going to be part of the relationship anymore, but damn, I was curious. It took a good 20 minutes for her to hand me her phone, a lot of crying, even a waitress asking her if she was ok.

So I read the messages. There wasn't any cheating like nudes being exchanged, them professing their love for each other, but what I read still stung. There was a lot of shit talking about me. A LOT. Texts and texts of them saying how terrible of a person I was, criticizing my hobbies (i like video games and pro wrestling) saying I wasn't a real man because of them and stuff like that. But there where two topics that caught my eye. One where she had told him I was having trouble getting hard and that was frustrating for her. And one where she was complaining about how she didn't want to be ""stuck"" in our relationship.

Yes, I was having problems in bed... because I was sad because my father had passed away (6 months ago) and the ""stuck"" thing, I remember telling her that when we got married, IF SHE WANTED she could leave her job, and I would provide for both of us. I don't know if she took this the wrong way, but I guess it was related to that. I honestly don't know.

By the time I gave her the phone back, she was already giving excuses on why she was saying those things to him, how he was like a ""therapist"" for her, and then she asked me ""don't you complaining about me to your friends?"" and I simply replied ""no, I don't"". She started crying again. I took a pretty deep breath and just said ""just give me the ring back"" (I didn't had the ring with me, like some suggested). She hesitated a bit, but gave it to me anyway. I stood up and asked her to delete my number and to not bother me anymore.

I called her mom and asked her to pick up her daughter's stuff at my place. Her mom is a good person, I'm just realizing I'm going to miss her as I write this. She understood why I decided to end it, but she didn't asked much, and to be honest, I'm glad she didn't. As for my mom, I didn't called her, I just blocked her for things unrelated to this post, I just realized she never had my back in anything, I was always trying to save an already failed mom-son relationship.

Before I leave, I just want to clarify. I was never against her having male friends, or any type of friends. People are going to cheat, friends or no friends. I remember my dad saying something to me when I was a teenager, he always said ""opportunity makes the thief"", but I do not agree with that. Anyway, since I have the next two weeks off work, I going to figure what to do with the wedding money, drink some booze, play games and watch Monday Night Raw later.

Peace.

PS: sorry for any typos, but I fixed the title now.

Edit: a couple of people are asking about the car. Is a 2015 Nissan Versa which she crashed 2 times, both times she rear ended someone. Never liked the car, weak engine, the interior feels cheap and overall bad, so for all I care she can keep that piece of shit. I would have more luck throwing it off a cliff than selling it.

Edit 2: Little update. Her mom called me a few hours ago to check on me and to ask when she could come and pick up ex's stuff. We spoke about the car and she basically ""forbid"" me to let her daughter keep the car because: 1 - I paid for it. 2 - Ex wouldn't be able to maintain it. So I'm going to keep the car until I'm able to sell it (god help me).

Also, some people called the story fake, cause they said I wasn't a ""real man"" for playing games, and yet they played WoW. To be honest, that's on me, cause I wasn't very clear. The ""real man"" thing was more about the pro wrestling hobby than the gaming hobby, but in some messages they clearly mocked me for playing some games (Life is Strange Series) in one I remember James saying something like ""How could a grown ass man play such a girly game and cry?"" Yes, I cried playing Life is Strange. I also cried to RDR2 (the I'm afraid cutscene still makes me emotional). I'm a crybaby I guess.

Also I want to thank everyone who message me to talk about wrestling and games, it really helped me take my mind out of everything. I haven't replied to everyone, but I intend to. If anything happens, I'll let you guys know. Be good people.

*James saying you‚Äôre not a real man because you play video games, while simultaneously creating his WoW character to match a girl who smacked him into the friendzone/backup plan option, is galactic levels of cuck fuelled irony*

*OP you gave your time effort and money to someone who didn‚Äôt deserve it. It‚Äôs unfortunate but it can happen. Take some time to heal and become the best version of yourself. All the best*

&#x200B;

**Tfuentexxx**

>is galactic levels of cuck fuelled irony

*Ouch! That was nicely done... This girls seems to be playing with two 'nice guys' (probably more than that), her ATM and her friendzoned cuck.*

&#x200B;

**Tfuentexxx**

*Dodged the ballistic missile! She did not want to be stuck to you, then why cry for a marriage she doesn't want. Oh, but she is going to miss the wedding, that's what she wanted. Let's see if her best friend/boyfriend can provide her with one. Oh man, there are four billion women in this planet, be patient yours will find her way to you, but not this POS.*

Case Solved: Death of Arvin and Lerma Lulu,153,1g46kho,ChikaPH,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g46kho,63,1728995525.0,"POLICE ARREST SEVEN INDIVIDUALS LINKED TO THE MURDER OF SPOUSES LULU

Camp Olivas, City of San Fernando, Pampanga ‚Äì Authorities have successfully apprehended seven suspects in connection with the brutal murder of spouses Arvin and Lerma Lulu, who were tragically shot to death in Santo Rosario, Mexico, Pampanga, on October 4, 2024.

Following a thorough investigation, tracker teams from the Mexico Municipal Police Station, along with the Pampanga Provincial Intelligence Unit (PIU), Regional Mobile Force Battalion (RMFB), and the 1st and 2nd Provincial Mobile Force Companies (PMFC), conducted a focused operation over two days, from October 13 to 14. Their dedicated efforts led to the arrest of two key suspects, Arnold Taylan (Gunman) and Arnel Buan (Backrider), in Nueva Ecija.

The initial statements provided by Taylan and Buan proved crucial, enabling authorities to identify and apprehend the remaining five suspects: Robert Dimaliwat, Rolando Cruz, Jomie Rabandaban, Sancho Nieto, and the alleged mastermind, Anthony Limon. Investigations revealed that Limon who is also an online seller like the victims had a Php 13M debt to the couple, providing a potential motive for the crime.

During the operations, law enforcement officials seized a total of nine firearms, including three (3) caliber 9mm pistols, five (5) caliber .45 pistols, one (1) .22 caliber rifle, and one (1) air gun.

PBGEN REDRICO A. MARANAN, Regional Director of Police Regional Office 3, commended the tireless efforts of the police operatives involved in this case, emphasizing the PNP‚Äôs unwavering commitment to delivering justice for the victims' families. ‚ÄúOur mission to ensure the safety and security of our community remains our top priority,‚Äù he stated. ‚ÄúWe will leave no stone unturned in our pursuit of justice and accountability for this heinous crime.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority, and we strongly condemn Iran for these brazen threats,‚Äù NSC spokesman Sean Savett said in a statement.

Swiss regulator orders UBS to bolster emergency plans üö®,244,1g44gfj,GME,https://i.redd.it/s1nvlrqvcwud1.jpeg,24,1728987955.0,"
The Swiss financial regulator has ordered UBS to bolster its emergency and recovery plans in light of the added risk it has taken on following its takeover of Credit Suisse last year.

In a statement on Tuesday morning, Finma said it had suspended its annual approval of UBS‚Äôs resolution strategy ‚Äî commonly known as its ‚Äúliving will‚Äù, which banks have to draw up in case they run into difficulties ‚Äî and called on the bank to improve its existing plan.

‚ÄúBased on the experience of the Credit Suisse crisis, additional options for action are required to further strengthen crisis preparations and resolution planning for systemically important banks,‚Äù the regulator said.

UBS is midway through its three-year integration of Credit Suisse, which collapsed last year following years of scandal and losses.

Large banks are required to provide their regulator with regular living wills, which set out how they could be wound down safely to limit contagion in the market and prevent state bailouts if they run into trouble.

Finma requires the banks it supervises to submit plans annually, which it shares with the Financial Stability Board, the international body that monitors risk in the global financial system.

‚ÄúUBS‚Äôs resolution planning must be further developed in order to increase the options for action available if there is a risk of insolvency,‚Äù Finma said.

The regulator said the plan needed to show how UBS could sell or wind down individual businesses ‚Äî as well as the entire bank ‚Äî without jeopardising stability in the financial system or requiring taxpayer money to support resolution.

Finma is requiring banks to take a greater interest in liquidity ‚Äî especially how quickly customers can pull out their savings ‚Äî and the impact of social media and digital banking on outflows, according to people familiar with the regulator‚Äôs thinking.

Credit Suisse suffered from rumours about its impending demise circulating on social media six months before its eventual collapse, which led to customers around the world withdrawing billions of dollars of deposits, contributing to its decline.

Switzerland is in the middle of a wide-ranging postmortem of Credit Suisse, whose collapse last year was the most significant bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis.

The government and regulator are considering a range of measures to improve stability in the Swiss financial system, whose reputation was rocked by Credit Suisse‚Äôs fall.

The measures include beefing up Finma‚Äôs powers and imposing more capital requirements on UBS, which is the country‚Äôs last remaining significant global bank.

‚ÄúUBS has a sustainable business model with a total loss absorbing capacity of around $200bn,‚Äù the bank said in response to Finma‚Äôs statement.

‚ÄúThe experience of the Credit Suisse crisis and the rescue by UBS now require the further development of resolution planning in order to expand existing plans in a targeted manner. UBS has already started this work.‚Äù

Credit Suisse‚Äôs recovery plans were never put to the test as the Swiss state leaned on UBS to rescue its former domestic rival in a controversial deal that involved wiping out $17bn of debt.

The blood warmer sounds like something that looks cool on paper and during demonstration, but actually turn out to be extremely impractical in heavy duty working scneario.

The concept itself is actually based on real hypothermia treatment - but that is done in stationary medical setting. Extracorporeal circulation can cause blood clotting and embolism, and anticoagulant would be prescribed - which then increase the risk of internal bleeding. Since the people with blood warmer would have to move around doing physical jobs instead of sitting still, it'd likely invite a lot more circulatory complications... or if the catheter breaks or gets snagged off... just imagine the amount of bleeding that would cause especially if it's the tube connected to artery.

Sure, Adaptation through technology, but how are you sure you're able to maintain your cool augmented bits out there in the bumfuck nowhere in the Frostpunk?

But I think that's what made them interesting, Stalwart vs Pilgrim feels more like a generic 'City folks vs Nomads' story (Though I prefer it narratively), but Faithkeeper route is definitely more unique and kookier, both factions are just more insane than Order route...

\[In Faith Route, New London crossed the line, since they have a 'New Religion' as described by Wanderers, they have *New Faith*. - but Order route just says they have militant squads and strong leadership, which doesn't require you to go full New Order...\]"

A few days ago, he traveled to Mumbai, where his parents resided, to gift them a car.  
  
The car delivery was delayed, and while returning from the showroom on his bike, with his wife as a pillion rider, his parents were in an auto ahead. Suddenly, another auto cut sharply in front of Akash, nearly causing him to fall. He honked and told the driver to be more careful.  
  
The auto driver became enraged and started hurling abuses. A physical altercation ensued, and auto driver called his friends. Soon, 15-20 people began assaulting Akash. His wife, mother, and father, who rushed to help, were also injured. Tragically, his wife suffered a miscarriage, and Akash succumbed to his injuries.  
  
Akash was not at fault, yet he paid with his life, the life of his unborn child, and left a family shattered forever.  
  
We have a serious issue on our hands. We're living among zombies, goons, and criminals, who won't hesitate to kill over something as trivial as overtaking or honking. But for you, your life and your family‚Äôs safety should matter more than your ego. It‚Äôs not worth working hard, paying taxes, only to be lynched on the road for no reason. Your argument won't change their minds. On the road, keep calm. Don‚Äôt argue. Don‚Äôt react. Let it go.  
  
This is called situational awareness, not cowardice. I‚Äôm not blaming Akash at all, he was right, but it‚Äôs better to be wrong and alive than right and dead.

I adopted her as a kitten, and she was there for me through all the ups and downs of becoming an adult. I had it in my head that she‚Äôd make it til 22, but her body had other plans. After 2 months in and out of the emergency hospital for unrelated (but maybe related?) issues, and then a long weekend where her bilirubin increased despite all the care through the hospital, we determined with many vets that exploratory surgery wasn‚Äôt worth the risk. She had a final day at home, no feeding tubes, just nonstop snuggles. We opted for at-home euthanasia, which I highly recommend if you have the choice. Everything about it was so peaceful, and she purred until the very end.

I miss her in so many little ways every day. Especially the snuggles. Sometimes I felt like she and I were one being. She would wait for me in bed, and then snuggle up on my chest until I fell asleep, then she would move to my pillow and wrap around my head. There was about 1-2 years as she developed arthritis and a healthy fear of our upstairs rabbit, and wouldn‚Äôt go upstairs to sleep with me. I finally moved our bedroom downstairs a year before she passed. I wish I had done it sooner.

I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôll ever find a cat who I have as amazing of a bond with as I did with Nala.

I was in a college sociology class when a test was announced on the day before a school break. The way our breaks worked was that they began immediately after your last class the day before. This class was from 6-8:30pm, after sundown. Yom Kippur began at sundown that night, and college was 5 hours away from my family, so I was going to travel that day and skip this one class.

I told my professor during class I could not make the exam because it was Yom Kippur. He reiterated that break began after your last class. He was a 70-year-old man from Lithuania and I figured maybe he didn‚Äôt realize how important this holiday is. I told him I understood, but this is a High Holiday and I‚Äôm Jewish, so I need to make it home before sundown to observe the holiday with my family. A few other people spoke up and said they too were Jewish and would have the same problem (this was plausible given where we were). He asked me how he can be sure it‚Äôs really Yom Kippur, so I suggested he Google it. Lo and behold, Google told us in big bold letters that the holiday began the night of the exam. 

He then hit me with ‚Äúwell how do I know you‚Äôre really Jewish?‚Äù So I told him I could produce photos from my Bat Mitzvah where I‚Äôm reading the Torah, but there are really no ‚Äúcertificates‚Äù to identify myself as Jewish. He insisted that these could be Photoshopped. 

I called my dad in front of him and put him on speaker. I explained to my dad that this professor needed proof that we‚Äôre Jewish and asked him if he can confirm or provide any more proof. He suggested that he could send the professor a photo of his circumcised dick if he needs proof, then called the professor a Nazi.

Needless to say, the next class day, he announced he was simply moving the test."

My partner (s), her brother (b), and me (k)- all in our forties- had level 2 tickets to exiled: crooked rose woods for last weekend. S and I drove the few hours to KC while talking through the lore and media/content related to the event. We were fkn gettin into it. 

On the way to the trail we listened to the podcast, and talked through the plot line. We booked an 830 spot and arrived about 15 min early to an anticipated line. Immediately, the vibe felt tense, but I was high and amped for the experience, so I brushed off the feeling. The crowd though, people were keyed up and getting loud about having to wait. I understood, because tickets weren‚Äôt cheap at a little over $200 for the two of us.

- a little background‚Ä¶ 

Apparently, Exiled Terror Trail has been around a while, but this year was the first time partnering with this director from some of the Saw movies and creating the immersive experience. So, while we had never been there, most of the crowd were seasoned patrons. There was expressed confusion on how the entry inside was processed, and after about 20 or so minutes folks were getting a bit impatient. 

Then, we can hear a woman yelling for everyone to, ‚Äúshut the fuck up, and listen.‚Äù We were positioned behind a wall and about 50 people separated us from her, so I‚Äôm not entirely sure what she said. here‚Äôs my best guess‚Ä¶ EVERYONE!! SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LISTEN IF YOU WANT TO GET INSIDE HERE TONIGHT! 
something about, ‚Äústarting right now,‚Äù there is no level 1 or 2 now, only level 2.  I think she explained what she meant, or she was arguing with someone in the crowd, because she yelled shut the fuck up a couple more times. She then repeated a few times that every single thing about tonight‚Äôs production being ‚Äúdifferent,‚Äù from any of the other experiences, but didn‚Äôt elaborate at all. 

We get to the front and are joined with another group of three, including 2 teens and maybe a mom. One of the teens was a girl wearing a birthday sash, there celebrating her 17th, the other was her boyfriend, maybe. 

The beginning of the trail was typical, and aside from the actors just staring blankly at me when I tried interacting, it was pretty standard. There was a spot when a female character put something in B‚Äôs mouth and covered his mouth with her and until he swallowed. I was a little surprised by it. Oh, and one of the actors grabbed b by the hair super rough, and tried to lead him into a shed saying how good he looked. 

Then we get to a place in the trail where a shitless older man blocked us from moving forward. He had blood all over him and he leaned into the girl and asked what year she was celebrating. His face is as close as it can be to hers without touching. She answered it‚Äôs her 17th birthday. He proceeded to bring his head down to her neck and sniffed up and down her throat and neck while he whispered how ‚Äúgood she smelled‚Äù. Then brought his face back up to hers and said a few times, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to taste you.‚Äù We endured this exchange for about 2.3 minutes, before putting ourselves between them and awkwardly scooting her past him. 

Once we passed him and a few more odd encounters, we were inside the carnival. Actors playing the characters from the podcast are dispersed throughout the carnival, and immerse the crowd in the plot. There are tents you can use tokens to enter, an escape room aptly named, ‚Äúuncle touchy‚Äôs,‚Äù and other carnival games you‚Äôd expect.

After collecting our tokens we grab a beer and go to the ‚Äúapothecary,‚Äù tent where uncle Frank puts on a show. At one point he ripped my hat from my head, paced the tent, then through it at me, which would be cool if it had anything to do with what he was monologuing. He gives us a jar of poison and tells us to give it to uncle Charlie, and also said to tell him he‚Äôs ugly. We find Charlie, who grabs the poison, opens it, and pours it into my partner‚Äôs beer, then all over my hands, and fucks off without saying anything.

This next part is what made me question whether this place was a front for a sex trafficking ring, because in case i forgot to mention, entry age is 12. There are 12 year old children running around. 

Okay, so next to the apothecary tent is a hotdog stand being operated by a man who‚Äôs about 6‚Äô4‚Äù and 300lbs. He‚Äôs wearing short satinish shorts, poorly covering his g string, being held up by suspenders. Which, honestly would be chill if not for him yelling loudly at everyone- including children- to put his meat in their mouth. 

It gets worse, because we wanted a hotdog, and so we got in line behind a group of young teens. How do I know they were young teens? Well, because one-by-one dude asked each of them how old they were, and they ranged from 13 to 15. 

We soon learned the two standing at the front of the line, both 15, were a couple, because the actor asked if they were. The actor tells the boy in order to get his hotdog he needs to rest his chin on the cart in front of the plate the actor had placed down with an open bun on top. He tells the kid when the hotdog is ready he needs to open his mouth so that the actor can slide the hotdog through the open bun and into his mouth. 

The kid is like, ha ha nah bro I‚Äôm not doing that. Then, for SEVEN FUCKING MINUTES this mfr tries to pressure him to do it by trying to engage his girlfriend and friends in bullying and insulting him. 

Finally- his hotdog is ready, but before he gives it to the kid he steps from his booth and walks around to where he‚Äôs standing toe to toe with this 15-year old boy. He starts yelling that he‚Äôs he‚Äôs too insecure in his masculinity, and then shifts to his girlfriend and starts in on her boyfriend being a walking red flag, tells her to break-up with his insecure ass for a man ‚Äúsecure in his masculinity.‚Äù 

There are so many more things I can share that completely icked me the fuck out, but this post is honestly way too long. One thing I will add is the way negative comments and reviews are responded to is actually bizarre. I didn‚Äôt personally leave  a review, comment, or complain in person, but I read a few that expressed disappointment in some form. The responses read something like, ‚Äúthe quality of the experience is dependent upon how deep you‚Äôre willing to dig into the immersion, so if you‚Äôre dissatisfied come back and dig deeper.‚Äù Like, wtf?

Crooked Rose Woods has been operating less than a month, and I have yet to discover a single blurb- anywhere- referencing the event‚Äôs sexually explicit nature. Nothing in the waiver, website, or reviews make mention whatsoever. If b and s weren‚Äôt there to validate the experience, I would question my reality.


Edit:[the waiver I signed](https://fareharbor.com/waivers?shortname=exiled&bookingUuid=7c3d00e7-7762-4c82-9572-9a89e34c68d0&source=copy-link)

(I still blame the advertising making me think it was H vs A... as opposed to the battle for the survival of the planet. The smoothness of my brain had nothing to do with it, I swear)

So  you'd think I would have picked up on the double meaning of 'The War Within' much sooner...as opposed to...well....just this week.

All of our main actors are dealing with and trying to overcome their personal demons, fears, their pasts, etc.

Same with the stories of each zone.

The writing is great, and in hindsight I feel a bit dumb for not clicking sooner.

So... how far in/how long did it take for you to make the connection?

  
EDIT: I missed the release, just back recently, and didnt see the Anduin/Thrall release cinematic. Whoops. They're literally saying it... like I said above...smooth brain but now off to watch the cinematics compilation. Thanks to all for pointing them out. Appreciated."

Last picture was my board state. The spread cards top right were my hand, the rest were my library. 
My d20 roll for turn order at the beginning resulted in a 13 as well, so it almost felt like the universe agreeing with me.

"As an Arab chatter, Asmongold's comments are disgusting and he used Hasan as damage control",572,1g3xziz,Hasan_Piker,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hasan_Piker/comments/1g3xziz/as_an_arab_chatter_asmongolds_comments_are/,92,1728960864.0,"I want to be very clear that I am sympathetic to Hasan's position of attempting to use a conversation with Asmongold as a way to reach his audience and potentially de-program some of them. Unfortunately, I do not think it worked, and instead it allowed Asmon to evade and water down his message while maintaining his core position. He got to dress up his position in slightly better words, but it remained largely the same.

To remind people, Asmongold stated that **Palestinians and Arabs have an inferior culture that is evil and immoral.** He doubled down on this the entire stream, and refused to budge even an inch on it. Whenever Hasan would press him, or make analogies to the US, Asmon would simply state that he thought ""Parts of US culture is bad too."" as an out, but he would never make the same sweeping generalizations about US culture, yet felt completely comfortable to do so about Arabs & Muslims.

It was disgusting to listen to. I do not think he is arguing in good faith -- Asmongold has the means, time, and money to research and develop an in-depth opinion on the middle-east. He doesn't. He instead plays to his right-wing audience while back-pedaling whenever it goes too far to maintain his centrist image. 

Arab culture is not evil or immoral. Arab people are kind, community driven people who care about honesty and integrity for the most part. Most Arabs are fine with live and let live, and if asked, would not want the death of LGBTQ+ people. Arab culture is my culture, and is filled with songs and poetry and food and scientific development. Arabs under an Islamic caliphate invented things like Algebra, developed chemistry, and invented a wide range of things we still use today like Kerosene, Hard soaps, wind powered structures of various sorts, sugar mills and more. There is literally a massive wikipedia page dedicated to the developments in science under the Golden Age of Islam. This was at a time when western europeans were dying of common diseases because hand washing was not a thing.

During the middle ages, where Europe was burning witches at the stake and gay people were tortured for sport, the Islamic world had openly gay philosophers. In the tradition of Sufi Islam, poets like Rumi **wrote about the great joys of homosexual love.** The laws against homosexuality on the books were rarely invoked. We know this because Arabs kept extensive court records and we can physically see with our own eyes how rare this was.

This does not mean there weren't problems or reactionaries, or periods of regression, but this is a beautiful vibrant culture with a long history of progressive development that Asmongold completely dismissed.

Asmongold, from his air-conditioned comfortable home sitting in an imperialist country that routinely destroys other peoples homes, hand-waved thousands of years of human development as if it was nothing, and then used some regressive modern regimes (created directly and indirectly by his own government) to play defense for Israel's genocide. 

The conversation with him was extremely painful and sad, and as my friends and family in Lebanon feels the weight of American bombs, I find it all so abhorrent and unfair. "

I've overcome the Mistlands as a sneaky archer, a heavy tank and a magician. All while on normal difficulty. I've killed the Queen three different times.

The Mistlands were challenging and the learning curve was steep, but it was never threw more at me than I could handle. I died a lot but it always felt fair when I died. 

The Ashlands have made me shamefully lower the difficulty time and again. The spawn rate is pure insanity. You never take on one enemy at a time; you take on six. I've tried different tactics and they all lead to death. 

I know the game is in early release, so I'm hoping the developers come to their senses and adjust the spawn rate, as this doesn't feel how, ""normal,"" difficulty should play. 

I'll say in advance;
1. Yup. I suck. 
2. Yes,  I've tried getting good. 
3. As stated above, I **have** lowered the difficulty. 
4. No, I'm not going to play an easier game. I love Valheim; the ashlands *need* adjustment. 
5. Nope. It's not a *me,* problem. 
6. Yes, I've tried using magic. 
7. I *do*, in fact, know how to parry and dodge-roll.
8. No, I didn't expect a walk in the park.
9. Cheesing the game with dirt walls doesn't feel like the right way to play the game. 
10. Yes, my biome is pockmarked with campfires which doesn't feel like it's in keeping with the *spirit* of the game. "

Last week I administered two epi-pens to a child having anaphylaxis outside my work (Hull, England) while I was on a smoke break. I introduced myself as a first aider, mother handed me the pens, I laid the child on the floor and injected him.

After 5 minutes he was still seriously struggling to breathe, father tried to stop me (I resisted him by putting a hand to his chest to hold him back) but I administered the second pen. Child started to breathe easier, ambulance came a few minutes later.

I am a trained first aider (3 day Red Cross course, 2 day child course) and suffer from a life-threatening allergy myself as does one of my siblings so have used them before. 

The father came to my work today and wants reimbursement for the second pen, and waffled to the receptionist about emotional damage (which I know I can ignore) administering excess medication illegally and common assault on him. He doesn't know my name but I'm easily identified by my hair colour and he obviously knows where I work. Do I get a wig and ignore him or will I be waiting for police/court? "

We've been together nearly 20 years, married for 11, with 3 kids. Sure she's gained a little weight after 3 kids, but I still find her as beautiful as the day we married.

Yesterday she patted her on the stomach and told her to also stand up straight while she was in our house. I had enough and texted her sister this morning to stop with the comments. She didn't take it well.

Ya‚Äôll aren‚Äôt lying. The Prera is a fantastic pen. ,86,1g46m6j,fountainpens,https://i.redd.it/b66d1a1uzwud1.jpeg,18,1728995674.0,"I have been on this sub for a couple of months. My collection started (in August) with a Kaweco sport, which I liked fine but could tell was a gateway drug. Then I got a Hongdian Forest for some more length and weight (and a lovely lilac color). 

Then I made a purchase based off of budget and everything I have read on this sub. It seems like the favorites here in the below $50 range are the Prera, Lamy Safari and TWSBI Eco. I don‚Äôt like the look of the safari so last week I got the Prera and the TWSBI Eco. My Prera arrived (in this vibrant magenta color) yesterday and I had to interrupt my Morning Pages (see (TAW) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artist%27s_Way], iykyk) to say that this is BY FAR THE NICEST PEN IN MY SMALL COLLECTION. I got medium nib because I write big and fast, so it looks better and feels better. But this nib is such a good mix of smooth (dare I say buttery) and a little grainy/crunch (not sure of the proper language, could also be the paper I‚Äôm using, but I‚Äôm trying to describe when you feel a little crunch/texture while you write?) and it is so fun to write with! I thought I was already having fun with the other two pens, but this is next level.

I chose the Prera in part too because I see so many people on here who have some break-the-bank collections but say the still use the Prera. If you‚Äôre like me and looking to spend less than $50 on a new pen, don‚Äôt walk RUN to get your Prera. It‚Äôs so worth it.

I have a converter coming Thursday (for now using the supplied black ink cartridge). I am so excited to use with my new sheen/shimmer inks in this baby. They should get to me before the weekend is over, from Yoseka üòç"

All the replies are the typical ‚Äútake a break bruh!‚Äù Or ‚Äúreading weekly makes arcs worse! Reread in full bro, it will magically become a way better arc!‚Äù

Bro, people need to accept that Oda hyped vegapunk for 15 years, gave him a connection to one of the Straw Hats that was never fulfilled (Franky), and gave him the expectation of solving or at least developing quite a few mysteries in the verse, and in the end his character basically did nothing cool, didn‚Äôt interact with franky at all, and gave us ONE PIECE (GODA) of new information. 

Not every problem with One Piece can be solved by ‚Äújust reread bro‚Äù, Egghead was cool in terms of hype and stuff that happened off the island, but Vegapunk‚Äôs character was handled like any other arc side character. "

‚ÄúWhy do these people feel so certainly that this is acceptable behavior? Do they engage in other fandoms like this?‚Äù *checks profile* ‚ÄúNope. Just Dropout. 

Is it perhaps the fact that the Dropout personalities don‚Äôt have the level of fame that other celebrities do? Allowing the fans to perceive them as ‚ÄúReachable‚Äù?

There is one homeopathic Doctor practising in Wakad and Baner Area by the name Anshita Singh Rathore. please avoid her. Because Of the below reasons:
1) Appointments are just namesake, She never adheres to the time. 10 o clock se appointment leti hain but walks in at 11:30 when the clinic is full. We keep on asking doctor kidhar... You can read about it on Google reviews. 
2)Charges for follow up keep on changing all the time, kabhi 15 days kabhi 3 weeks kabhi month ke baad. So much of confusion and we cant ask her anything. 
3) not all illnesses are cured by Homeopathy, but this DF will insist to continue her medicines only even when the situation gets worse after having her medicines. Acceptance nahi hain. 
4) For PCOD, PCOS, Hormonal Disorders customers, the moment she discovers that you're almost cured, kuch aisa medicine de degi ki aap wapas 0 zero pe aajao. Basically she wants to keep minting money from your illnesses and not cure you. 
5) Hormonal problems jinko hain, unko har choti cheez k liye she'll insist to take medicines only and only from her. And jab tak 4 chakkar kaatenge nahi tab tak you won't get better at all. And in between if you go to another doctor, she'll start taunting you agressively about it and almost deny to give her diagnosis citing ab mei kuch nhi kar skti. Go to that doctor only... 
6) God Forbid, if anyone leaves a negative review, She first does character assassination and shows how she's right and condescending remarks and threatens them with Legal action if the client doens't take down the negative reviews. 

She's a doctor who just wants to make money and has no empathy to the patients. 
The longer you come, the longer she makes money. So avoid. "

""We tried everything we could think of, but nothing was working."" said KT head coach Nukeduck. ""While we wanted to wait until the finals to pull out this strat, we felt now was the appropriate time.""

And Nukeduck says the results speak for themselves. Just yesterday in scrims, the team went 3-0 against BLG, and 0-3 against PNG. ""Since this change, almost everyone on the team has adjusted their play style and become a lot more volatile.""

Nukeduck wants to assure fans that Bwipo's play style remains unchanged.

Initial reception from fans has been less than anticipated.

""I had wanted see FLY play against GENG because they were so close in their series against HLE."" said an unbiased KT fan. ""Now that they've rebranded to KT, however, I just can't get excited for this team. There is absolutely nothing exciting about this upcoming match now for KT's side.""

KT hopes that this strat will be enough to get them into the semi finals, where they have leaked that they are preparing for a shift to SSG should T1 come out on top in the series."

Just incredible that I found the color he envisioned, an Artic Grey '24 718 Cayman, with the black Cayman S wheels. I wanted him to get the dream car he wanted to retire with. Definitely a motivational experience that I will cherish with my father for the rest of my life! üöòü©∂"

Displaced five times. Forced to flee. Gaza.,204,1g44keu,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/1g44keu/displaced_five_times_forced_to_flee_gaza/,10,1728988421.0,"My name is Yamen Nashwan, and I am from Gaza. My family and I have been displaced five times since the conflict began, and each time, our situation has only worsened.

The first time we were forced to leave was from our home in Beit Hanoun. We sought refuge at my sister Nour's house in the Jabalia camp, hoping to find some safety there. But the war didn‚Äôt spare us. When the situation became unbearable, we had to walk nearly 20 kilometers with my sick father and mother to Al-Shifa Hospital in western Gaza.
There were no means of transportation available, and the streets were unsafe. Prices for basic necessities were skyrocketing, and we had already lost our jobs, leaving us without any income to support ourselves.

Our journey didn‚Äôt end there. From Al-Shifa, we were forced to move again, this time to a shelter school in the Nuseirat area. The conditions were harsh, but we tried to make do with what little we had. 

However, as the conflict continued, we found ourselves moving once more, this time to Rafah, where we now live in a small tent. The tent offers little protection from the elements, and our struggles have only deepened.

One of the most harrowing experiences was when my father, who had already been He was injured in his foot and  suffering, fell and needed urgent medical attention. We had to carry him to the hospital in the dead of night, under the threat of aerial bombardments. 

The fear for our lives was overwhelming, but we had no other choice. After a failed surgery in Rafah, we had to move him again to Al-Zawaida, hoping he might recover. However, the lack of food, medicine, and basic care has made his condition worse. We are desperate and exhausted, both physically and emotionally.

Our story is one of countless others in Gaza. We have lost our homes, our jobs, and any sense of normalcy. 
Imagine my brothers and sisters. The life we lead? Do we deserve this? I had such a beautiful life. How do we go on? üíî"

Without hesitation, Adam complied, scrubbing away at the sink. But after washing only a few dishes, the officer appeared again.

""Adam, change of plans. You're needed in the supply room. Make sure everything‚Äôs secured in case of rough waters.""

Again, Adam followed the order and made his way to the supply room. Inside, he found another crewman stacking boxes. Adam, a bit frustrated, spoke up.

""Hey, is it normal to keep getting shuffled around like this? I‚Äôve been reassigned three times already, and it‚Äôs only been 15 minutes!""

The crewman chuckled and said, ""Welcome to the sub, Adam. This place is full of reposts."""

Confusion and ramblings pertaining to the ‚Äúinferior culture‚Äù shit from an Arab viewer ,111,1g46pr9,Asmongold,https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/1g46pr9/confusion_and_ramblings_pertaining_to_the/,200,1728995984.0,"I‚Äôve been a viewer for some time and while I‚Äôve never cared for any content creators political opinions (I watch twitch for entertainment. not to be enlightened lol) this recent stuff has been a bit strange to say the least. My only goal is to have a good faith discussion and understand asmons/chats pov.

I‚Äôll start of by tokenizing myself a bit :p I‚Äôm Arab AND currently live in the Middle East. Im also collecting all the oppression infinity stones by being a woman, queer, and not religious. Everything asmon said about sharia law/islam checks out HOWEVER what he fails to realize is that the overwhelming majority of Muslims ‚Äúpractice‚Äù the religion on a very surface level and aren‚Äôt aware of the terrible things the Quran actually preaches. I live in Saudi where ‚Äú‚Äùsharia law‚Äù‚Äù is technically implemented yet the vast majority of people around me live lifestyles that happen to be the exact opposite of what sharia supposedly enforces. Sharia law has been in practice here all my life yet I‚Äôve seen the country/culture evolve so much DESPITE it, due to the law only being there by name/on paper.

I think every criticism of Islam is valid and necessary, however i would never consider Muslims to be a monolith, let alone Arabs/Palestinians like asmon did in my opinion :( There‚Äôs almost  no democracy in the Middle East and as a result the political figures that represent us don‚Äôt usually convey what us, the people, believe in.

Islam is incompatible with the west/me and a lot of people‚Äôs lifestyles and existence. Yet I still live here, in a Muslim country where I have a large circle of lgbt Muslim/non Muslim friends that I am very much out to! The country I live in doesn‚Äôt represent me or my thoughts and to think someone could justify violence being committed against people like us due to said unwanted representation frankly makes me depressed.


Also side note bc im petty lol :p ff16 isn‚Äôt banned, it‚Äôs just not localized much like many other games here. I own a physical copy I got from my local game store. No one likes the weird censoring the government is doing it‚Äôs all performative to keep up a certain image 



Hopefully this doesn‚Äôt get too controversial and taken down :,)"

Of those 45 that turned the project in, maybe 10 actually read the instructions beyond the title. 

They had to design a themed room for a haunted house based on one of the suspenseful stories we read in our unit. I got a lot of haunted houses with no tie in to the content. One kid just glued (poorly) construction paper into a cereal box, cut a door in it and with a pen, drew an eye. Other kids made intricate, massive houses out of cardboard with spider webbing and pumpkins. Sadly, the cereal box kid scored higher on the rubric because I could tell which story they were referencing. 


Now, so I don't have 45+ failures, I get to give an ""alternate assessment"" in the form of a 14 page end of unit test. I suspect I will probably have 40 failures instead but at least I differentiated the assessment deliverables üôÑ

As the only Black lead on New Girl for the majority of its run, the actor strongly related to his character's struggles.

> ""Garrett being a fish out of water, I definitely felt that in my early years,"" Lamorne Morris tells Entertainment Weekly. ""Being in New Girl, I was a new character after the first episode, so a lot of time was spent trying to develop my character and figure out who I was on the fly. And even though it's not personal, sometimes you take it personal, and you're like, 'What the hell, man? I'm the one Black character on this show, and they don't know how to figure out my character. He ain't got no job. Is that the storyline now?'"""

If it is that play it looks like a forward lateral but I don't know for sure if that is the play or not. All I know is the official box score is now saying 18 carries for 113 yards (11.3 points) and 5 catches for 56 yards (10.6 PPR points, 8.1 .5 PPR points).

It's actually kind of funny and obvious once pointed out. Here is one of the key paragraphs from Shellenberger's reporting:  
  
>The report concludes that ‚Äúthe existence of IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION demonstrates the extant **capability to detect, quarantine, and transfer UAP and ARV [Alien Reproduction Vehicle] collection incidents before they are observed and circulated within the Military Intelligence Enterprise**, thus serving as a means of enforcing internal information security.
  
""Immaculate"" means clean.  
  
""Constellation"" means...stars in the night sky.  
  
This program gets first dibs on military sensor data, before the data goes anywhere else. If there are any UFOs in that sensor data, they are *immaculately* scrubbed out of the picture or removed from the data stream, so that you don't have any unsightly UFOs ruining otherwise nice pictures of *constellations* in the night sky."

I didn‚Äôt want to scare her away so I waited and kept my fingers crossed and she brought in a kitten on June 25th ( pic 3‚Ä¶.Baloo)

No more for 2 days and I thought that was it and then, 3 more. (Pic 5‚Ä¶Sid, left and Burt.  Floyd was hiding).

My neighbour came 2 days later saying she‚Äôd seen 2 kittens in her bushes and sure enough Pickle brought them in.

6 weeks of absolute chaos ensued. It was the absolute best time. Every time I moved there would be teeth or claws, I‚Äôve never cleaned so much and still had a mess everywhere.

"Response to - ""Has everyone forgotten this already?""",2441,1g3ngm8,conspiracy,https://i.redd.it/pp62s2urprud1.png,705,1728931761.0,"So you want the true story to the 770 tunnels? I literally grew up with one of the guys arrested. It's not what folks are saying.

It's not shiz or blood and it's obsurd to me that these guys are assigning all hell to these merely goofy ass Jewish teensü§£

The real situation is Religious drama and typical stupid teenage behavior combined. Basically this is a Chabad (Lubavitch) synagogue at 770 Eastern Parkway Brooklyn New York.

It's a sacred place for us (I'm not longer religious but it's my family and friends) because it is our last Rabbi's - Menachem Mendel Schneirson the Lubavitcher Rebbes home base. He passed away like 30 years ago ever since there has been a divide in leadership of 770 specifically. Just like nobody can agree on anything in politics, it's the same here. The shul (synagogue) is a dump. Not because the money doesn't exist, but because none of the head Rabbi's can agree on anything and get their act together. 

The Lubavitcher Rebbe was fully set on expanding 770 and it's been 30 years since his passing. The teenagers decided they are fed up with the politics and the lack of action and decided to expand 770 themselves, HENCE THE TUNNELS.

The mattress seen in this viral picture was used to transport the rubble that they were breaking off from the walls to who fricking knows where (probably just moved it to the side to make room for more digging) Yes a mattress. I assume they brought it from the bochurims dorm room called 749 (young adult dorm) where there are plenty of mattresses.

Want to talk about how stupid reckless and silly this is? Go ahead I'll join you. But blood and shiz? If you are seriously telling people this you are perpetuating lies. Personally, I think it's hilarious because I grew up around many of the bochurim in 770, they are extremely lively, goofy/funny and hippie like in many ways. I used to be one of them myself! 

Ask me any questions you want I am happy to answer with everything I know.

Random details: I think the tunnel was being dug to connect with another building but not entirely sure where they were digging to. I also know they didn't start from scratch, for years that general area was boarded up I think it was some unfinished room or something. Do they just took off the boards and started expanding that random room. Yes it is against the law. How serious were they about digging the tunnel? Not sure but how fricking serious can they be?? Only the real goofheads were doing this everyone was studying with their partners as usual and they were using a mattress to move the rubble so how serious could they be?

Anyway chat with me in the comments peace"

&#x200B;

 **Boss wants us to do early-morning and evening meetings so he can attend from his vacation**

&#x200B;

I work on a small team that has daily meetings at 10 am, usually lasting 30-60 minutes. I personally don‚Äôt think daily meetings are even necessary, but they are my boss‚Äôs way of keeping up with our work as he rarely meets with any of us individually and he likes for us to know what everyone else is working on.

My boss‚Äôs work is his life, so he frequently will work in the evenings and on weekends. He recently said about Thanksgiving, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs another day for me to get some work done.‚Äù (Thankfully, he does not outright pressure others to follow his example, although as you‚Äôve noted before it sets a bad example coming from the boss.)

As you can imagine, he has built up a lot of unused vacation leave, and despite our organization‚Äôs generous carry-over policy, he was going to start losing hours. His solution was a two-month trip to Asia. The problem is, even though he is going to be using leave, he is planning to keep working the entire time and attending our meetings (we already work remotely). With the time difference, our regular meeting time would be the middle of the night for him, so he proposed the times that have the best overlap between timezones, early morning here (7 am) or evening (5-9 pm).

I typically work an 8:30-5 day and have a fairly rigid schedule outside of that with daycare drop-offs, a toddler to take care of, and regular evening activities. I responded with the following: ‚ÄúI can make the occasional meeting outside of regular working hours, but with my schedule and childcare responsibilities I can‚Äôt regularly do so.‚Äù

His suggestion was that he attends two meetings a week, one early morning and one evening, and we meet at the regular time the other days and write up a summary to send him.

While I could probably make this work most of the time, it will be a real burden. It would be one thing if my boss was on business travel, or if it was just a week or two, but he‚Äôs on two-month vacation leave. I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have to accommodate his travel on principle.

How much should I push back on this? I can‚Äôt force him to not work on his leave, but his choice to keep participating in our meetings is putting me in an awkward position. I can probably opt out when it is especially inconvenient, but I will feel bad about it. When I do make it to the meetings, I will feel angry that I have to be there guilty about the extra burden it puts on my husband. Is there any way to say he can‚Äôt do this while on leave?

*You know if this would work in your team or with your boss, can you say ‚ÄúWith my family obligations I can‚Äôt make these hours work. Can someone record the call please?‚Äù*

*I use an AI notetaker for all my Zoom/Slack calls, and it not only word for word transcribes, it also creates a summary. I send the link to the full recording and summary out to everyone on the invite list after every meeting. dusts of hands done.*

*Another suggestion would be to send him the daily transcripts from your regularly scheduled meetings. It sounds like from the letter it is more about him knowing what y‚Äôall are doing than offering up any sort of direction or help to you.*

*I was going to suggest not having the regular 10am meetings to make up for the inconveniently-timed meetings. It sounds like they‚Äôre mostly for the boss‚Äôs benefit anyway. Everyone can just send him a summary of whatever they‚Äôre doing individually.*

**Update - 9 months later**

&#x200B;

My question was posted a couple months after I wrote in, toward the end of my boss‚Äôs ‚Äúvacation,‚Äù but I ended up doing some of what was recommended. The particular issue I wrote about, the outside of work hours meetings, ended up not being a big issue but my boss‚Äôs vacation led to all sorts of other ridiculousness.

My boss left for his vacation without a specific plan in place for our meetings and we only ended up having meetings twice, once each during the first two weeks. After his first request for a call, I brought up to the rest of the group that this would be challenging for me, and another colleague with kids said he also had a hard stop at 5 pm. We reported back that we couldn‚Äôt do after 5, but could do a 4 or 4:30 pm meeting, which my boss agreed to. I think early on in the trip he was jet lagged but as he adjusted he wasn‚Äôt as keen on getting up so early in the morning. He never ended up suggesting a 7 am meeting time, so I guess he wasn‚Äôt keen on staying up late either.

The last I heard about having any meetings was when he emailed me asking, ‚ÄúDo we have a video call planned this week?‚Äù I understood this as a request to set up a meeting. However, since he wasn‚Äôt direct about it, I just replied ‚ÄúNo, I haven‚Äôt heard any plans for this week.‚Äù I heard nothing back.

Some of the commenters picked up on the part of the letter where I said I would feel bad about not attending meetings, not that I was worried about other consequences. My role was pretty critical to the group and my boss is non-confrontational so I wasn‚Äôt at all worried about being fired. I could have just said no to the meetings and I might have gotten a mildly worded email suggesting I try to join. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have felt bad but I would have, and it would‚Äôve added an extra layer of stress that didn‚Äôt need to be there.

What became the real problem is the barrage of emails he‚Äôd send us each day, often treating everything as urgent whether or not it really was. This included responses on issues he didn‚Äôt have the context on because he wasn‚Äôt at our meetings (and that we were able to handle without him just fine) and sending the same request separately to multiple people if they didn‚Äôt get back fast enough, which once led to three people repeating the same task. What he lacked in management skills was just made worse when he was managing from his vacation.

There were multiple deadlines during his vacation that he didn‚Äôt adequately plan for or keep us informed about, which resulted in a lot of last-minute urgent requests to get things done. I knew of one deadline that would come up while he was gone, so before he left I emailed asking if he needed me to do anything to take care of it. I got no response, so I assumed it was handled. Then, the day of the deadline, the person outside our group who was submitting the project contacted me requesting documents, saying that she‚Äôd contacted my boss and hadn‚Äôt heard back. Since they were due that day and my boss was asleep on the other side of the planet, I had to scramble to get them done as best I could without all of the context. After all that, he finally replied with ‚Äúno thank you‚Äù but a complaint about how I‚Äôd worded something. I replied asking how we should be handling things like this while he‚Äôs on vacation so this doesn‚Äôt happen again, and he just said we all need to make sure nothing falls through the cracks, just like when he‚Äôs not on vacation. Unhelpful.

It might make more sense to learn that we are academia-adjacent, doing research but also selling the product. My boss runs the group like an absent-minded professor, only caring about the research he finds interesting and dropping the ball on all of the other work and management the position requires.

It turned out part of the reason for his trip, and the reason he was so inconveniently located for meeting times, was that he was teaching a class overseas on the topic of our research. One of the most problematic things that came up was that he sent a coworker URGENT requests for material that ended up just being for the class he was teaching. My coworker obliged but I was once again upset on principle because this was not part of our jobs at all. Sure enough, instead of being well rested when he returned, he seemed overworked from teaching a class on top of keeping up with his normal work. He confirmed that he worked every day of his leave.

The commenters had some wild speculations about why my boss was taking vacation at all if he was just going to be working. I eventually learned that he was trying to do a financial trick to save the group a bit of money. Apparently the money to cover his salary on vacation days came from a different pot than his regular salary, because the vacation money had already been paid for, in a sense? He hates the part of his job where he has to actually fund the group, so he was eager to save some cash, or I suppose not incur extra costs by letting paid vacation go to waste.

I only learned about this because he tried to pull it again later. About a month after returning, he had a planned surgery and was encouraged to go on FMLA until he was able to work again. Well, he wouldn‚Äôt let a surgery get in the way of being able to work all the time so he was back at our virtual meeting the very next day and even went to work for our in person days the following week when he had told us he wouldn‚Äôt be able to drive for several weeks. A week after the surgery, he sent us an email saying he was going on FMLA for his surgery so he wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to go into the office but we could still keep meeting if we kept it on the down-low. This was even more concerning to me than his vacation because there are legal rules around FMLA and I wondered if I was even allowed to communicate with him during his leave.

Our HR was competent enough to put an end to this by noticing that he was still working (I‚Äôm guessing by watching his email or computer activity) and saying he needed to stop or go off of FMLA. Unfortunately they communicated this poorly, by telling our group admin that she had to pass along the message. I heard from her that HR told her to threaten to fire him if he didn‚Äôt stop working and said if they had to, they would threaten to fire our team if we communicated with him during his leave (or, they would tell our admin to threaten to fire us). This is when I learned that his reason for trying to take all this leave is to save money, as the FMLA pay would also have come from a different bucket than our group‚Äôs direct funds. My boss was incensed, especially because it was going to take a few days for him to get a doctor‚Äôs approval to go off FMLA and he couldn‚Äôt be bothered to take even a few days off. He never stopped working, but I assume he ended the FMLA because I didn‚Äôt hear any more about it. If his plan had gone through, he would have been on some form of leave for five months out of a seven-month period, all the while working every single day anyway. Bizarre.

For this and a host of other issues, I started looking for a new job around the time I wrote to AAM. It took over half a year and some disappointments along the way, but I ended up getting a new position that is a better fit for my experience and a 15% raise! On top of that, the new company ran the interview process really well by AAM standards with lots of timely communication and transparency, so I have a good feeling about how things will be run at the new job.

I‚Äôd previously been surprised reading through AAM updates at how many people say they left the job they had written in about, but now I see that when you‚Äôre writing about one specific weird situation, there are probably a bunch of other issues going on that we don‚Äôt hear about.

I had an accident on 10th Oct, I was driving my two wheeler back from the showroom after getting it serviced and i was slow as fuck coz the mechanic told not to exceed the speed limit of 40 for a few days as he had repaired the valve coz the engine had seized. 

Near the intersection on my way home, i slowed down as there was a dog in front of me (mind you, i don't wear earphones while driving and i slow down after I check there are other vehicles behind me or not in the mirror and by turning around once or twice and if there are other vehicles behind me i go to the side of the lane), so i slowed down and there was no vehicle behind me, all of a sudden, a guy in a Dio scooty driving at the speed of light crashes into me from behind, mai bc itna shocked tha I didn't know squat what had just happened, but adrenaline rush ke wajah se uth ke road ke side chala gya and then I fell unconscious. 

I woke up in the fucking hospital, after surgery, with significant amount of trauma to my left elbow joint, i can't feel my fingers, i can't move my left hand and the doctor said if there isn't any improvement they might have to amputate. 
I was fucking speechless and i still am. I never drove above 40-50 speed limit in my entire life, always been careful on the road but yeh Dio scooty ke 14 pata nhi kyu aisa karte hai. Hell dude I'm preparing for MBA rn and I'm in the hospital for the past 4 days.

And fyi, the guy who crashed into me i don't know if he sustained any injuries or not coz before passing out I saw him pick up his scooty and drive away in a hurry. HE RAN AWAY!! AFTER CRASHING INTO ME!! PUTTING ME IN A FUCKING HOSPITAL AND MY HAND ALMOST AT A STAGE OF AMPUTATION!! 

I've filed an FIR already against that guy, thankfully my mom told me that she and another relative of mine enquired around the area of crash and some of the locals recognised that guy as he was a local too and has had another accidents at different places so he's easy to catch. 

End of rant - 

I just want to say that, please stay careful out there! You will be at no fault and still end up being in a situation like this. I hope y'all have a good day. "

There will be parts where it may seem like the game is almost finished. It is not. Do not worry about optimizing your dungeon route or your royal virtues. I quite literally spent two weeks straight doing nothing at the end of the game, and that was me not even trying to min-max the relationships to their fullest. 

I played really, really casually, and I still managed to pretty much 100% the game (except for those godamn golden beetles. I have no idea where they all are). Don‚Äôt worry about some followers being unavailable for some periods of the game, too. They‚Äôll open up later once you reach a certain point.

Basically, just have fun. I clocked in 60 hours after finishing the game, and I honestly love how they approached the relationship system. It allows you to have a more enjoyable experience rather than worrying about wrong dialogue picks or finishing the dungeons all in one go."

Always have been. We have a pretty good life great son and a house over our heads, but we always wanted more. Property, and the ability to do what we want. I make ok money but just enough to basically live where we are now. 

She put her 2 weeks in today because she hates customers service and talking to customers. She says she wants to do something she like but has no clue what that could possibly be. She a good employee and her company knows this. So when she told them she was leaving they offered her 1000 shares of the company. If she stays another year she could possibly gain another 2000. She has to work for 5 years before she can sell them. The rate the company is growing and projected to be in 5 years would effectivly make us a little over $1,000,000. 

Imo setting us up for the rest of our lives... But she refused and is still looking for another job. 

I feel selfish AF for even considering to tell her to ""Tuff it out for 5 years"" but I also want her happy.... That's all I really want, but it's also A LOT of money to us... AITAH


Edit- Didn't expect this to blow up. But thank you all for your opinions. We talked and I listened to the majority of you all. Her mental well-being is worth a lot more than any money.. She is moving on. Time to start a job hunt. Wish her luck! "

But for me Cailee is the 2nd best we ever had. Not only I like how her character was written to be ""just a random person"" and not a scientist, soldier etc. but also her subtle but powerfull performance was just fantastic. She has the right presence, she's baddas but also can be vulnerable and her charisma is just right to be the lead.

I REALLY hope we'll get to see her more in the future because for me - She's the 2nd best lead in the entire franchise. "

I mean, look at that hair!üòç She has to be awesome! Well, that‚Äôs not what ended up happening. Instead, I found a character who provides yet another reason why Xander lacks good judgement. 

Peri is a serial killer employed by the kingdom. The game wants you to sympathize with her for having a tragic backstory, but not only is that not an excuse, but it‚Äôs hardly any worse than the backstories of other characters. I know trauma can affect people differently but she is just unbelievably horrible and no one seems to care. She has some of the worst supports in the game, with especially awful contenders being Corrin, Xander, Felicia, Leo, Kaden, and that‚Äôs just what I can think of. She‚Äôs an entitled sociopath who is rarely challenged to be a better person, and to be honest? She just makes people worse. Especially when they feed into her tendencies despite it being morally reprehensible (Corrin is especially egregious). She is a bad character and poisons everything around her. What‚Äôs not to hate?"

OverviewThe final part of our 60 day commitment is here!  
This patch marks the last set of changes we aimed to implement for the 60 day community commitment while also addressing issues we previously didn‚Äôt have time to fix.  
  
So what does this patch contain?  
We have made changes to the remaining weapons and stratagems we weren't able to finish for the patch on September 17th, ensuring they‚Äôre now more interesting and effective. We have also dedicated some time and we‚Äôve looked over some key core systems like enemy spawning as well as targeting and vision for the Automatons. Based on your feedback, we‚Äôve fine-tuned the Automaton experience to hopefully make them feel less frustrating to play against. Additionally, we have also adjusted the Helldivers durability to make your armor choices feel more impactful.  
  
Finally, we've introduced new functionality to certain items to give players more depth in mastering their equipment. For example, the GR-8 Recoilless Rifle and the AC-8 Autocannon now have programmable ammunition, and drones that come with backpacks can be toggled on or off for added control.  
  
We hope you enjoy these changes! The team at Arrowhead has been thrilled to work on this 60-day commitment for you, our community and players and seeing your reactions to the work we‚Äôve done! Together, we aim to ensure Helldivers 2 delivers on its core fantasy and remains a game we all love to play.  
  
BalancingGeneral changes  
Additional Supply Items are now visible on the minimap  


* Exosuits 
* Support Stratagems 

Removed ricochets from Orbital Stratagem projectiles, Eagle-1 bombs and FAF-14 Spear missiles  


* They can no longer ricochet off of targets 

Helldiver armor tweaks, both Heavy and Light armor are now more effective  
  
Heavy armor reduces damage taken by 25%, up from 20%  


* 5% more damage reduction 

Light armor increases damage taken by 25%, down from 33%  


* 8% less damage taken 

Stratagems and Weapon tag description updates, they now show more information and are also categorized

* Armor penetration 5+ is classified as Anti tank 

Primary Weapons  
Plasma projectile behavior  


* We‚Äôve standardized the behavior of Plasma projectiles, which previously had varying characteristics in how they traveled through the air. Now, all Plasma projectiles experience high drag, causing them to slow down faster. However, each plasma weapon still fires projectiles at different speeds and calibers, so their effective ranges will remain distinct. For most weapons, this change won‚Äôt be very noticeable 
* With the SG-8P Punisher Plasma you‚Äôll see a less pronounced arc in its projectile path. Instead, it will start off faster and lose speed more rapidly, keeping its effective range about the same 

PLAS-101 Purifier  
Projectiles can now be charged up with a damage multiplier that scales  


* Minimum charge of 0.1 sec gives a 50% damage multiplier

* Maximum charge projectile durable damage increased from 50 to 100 
* Maximum charge explosion damage increased from 150 to 300 
* The explosion doesn‚Äôt scale, but a fully charged shot has a different explosion effect: 
* Minimum charge (0.1‚Äì0.99 sec): Inner radius 1m, outer radius 2m, explosion damage 75 
* Maximum charge (1 sec): Inner radius 2.9m, outer radius 3m, explosion damage 300

Stratagem Support Weapons  
AC-8 Autocannon  
New weapon function: Programmable ammunition now allows you to switch between normal and and flak projectiles  


* Flak projectiles are proximity triggered shrapnel explosions with a larger explosion radius 

GR-8 Recoilless Rifle

   * Explosion damage increased from 250 to 350 
*  
* Orbital Airburst Strike
*  
   * Salvoes increased from 3 to 4 
   * Duration between salvoes increased from 3 to 4 sec 
*  
* A/MG-43 Machine Gun Sentry
*  
   * Magazine capacity increased from 125 to 175 
   * Cooldown reduced from 120 to 90 sec 
   * Life time reduced from 180 to 150 sec 
*

*  
* MD-17 Anti Tank Mines

   * Lifetime reduced from 180 to 150 sec 
*  
* FX-12 Shield Generator Relay
*  
   * Removed charge delay between damage taken 
   * Increased charge rate from 300 to 400 health/sec 
   * Radius increased from 8 to 15m 
   * Once the shield is down, it will no longer regenerate 
*  
* Gameplay
* Patrol Spawning
*  
   * Previously, once the mission was completed but before extraction, we significantly increased patrol spawns across the entire map. Now,¬†the increased patrol spawns are concentrated around the extraction site, with more patrols appearing the closer you are to it. This change should make patrol spawning feel more logical and reduce the penalty for players who complete the mission but still want to explore the map or collect samples. Please let us know if you still experience issues with the patrol spawning! 
*  
* Terminids
*  
* Bile Spewers
*  
   * Legs health reduced from 300 to 200 
*  
* Nursing Spewers
*  
   * Legs health reduced from 300 to 200 
*  
* Hunters
*  
   * Have a short shared area cooldown for their pounce ability 
   * Can now totally blow up if affected with enough damage 
*  
* Scavengers
*  
   * Can blow up if affected with enough damage 
*  
* Automatons
*  
* Automaton Targeting
*  
   * Some enemies were able to shoot at you without needing proper line of sight, which caused them to fire into or through walls, track you even when hidden, and ignore smoke effects. We've addressed these issues, so now you should be able to use stealth more effectively against the Automatons, and they won‚Äôt be able to shoot through walls or see you when they shouldn‚Äôt. Please let us know if you still encounter issues like these! 
*  
* Automaton projectiles
*  
   * Normal small projectiles damage reduced from 40 to 35, used by enemies like the Devastators, Emplacements and Conscripts 
   * Heavy projectiles damage reduced from 65 to 60, used by enemies like the Heavy Emplacements and Scout Striders 
*  
* Hulk Bruiser
*  
   * In response to their disapproval of a newly installed cannon on the Automaton Hulk Bruisers, Super Earth High Command sent a crack commando to sabotage their production facilities. The skilled operative promptly escaped into the shadows after completing their mission. Today, still wanted by the Automatons, they survive as a soldier of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can enlist‚Ä¶ John Helldiver 
   * As a result the Automatons had to revert back to using rocket launchers for their Hulk Bruisers 
*  
* All Devastators
*  
   * Head armor decreased from 2 to 1 
   * Head health increased from 100 to 110 
*  
* Berserkers
*  
   * Head health decreased from 125 to 110 
*  
* Heavy Devastator
*  
   * The pause between their salvoes has been slightly increased, providing Helldivers with a better opportunity to counterattack 
*  
* All Tanks
*  
   * Front armor reduced from 6 to 5, our previous tweak didn't have the intended effect on gameplay that we expected so we‚Äôve reverted this back 
   * The rear weak spots of the Tank's body now have their own health pool, which matches the Tank's previous total health. Once this health pool is depleted, the Tank will be destroyed. Additionally, these weak spots also deal 150% damage to the Tank's main health 
*  
* Annihilator Tank Turrets & Shredder Tank Turrets
*  
   * The rear weak spots of the Tank's body now have their own health pool, which matches the Tank's previous total health. Once this health pool is depleted, the Tank will be destroyed. Additionally, these weak spots also deal 200% damage to the Tank's main health 
*  
* Barrager Tank Turret
*  
   * The Turret is now destroyed if the Tank body is destroyed 
*  
* Fixes
* Resolved Top Priority issues:
*  
   * Not enough enemies spawn to complete Eradicate missions 
   * Some enemies were able to shoot at you without needing proper line of sight, which caused them to fire into or through walls, track you even when hidden, and ignore smoke effects 
   * Patrol Spawning should now feel more logical and reduce the penalty for players who complete the mission but still want to explore the map or collect samples 
*  
* Crash Fixes and Soft-locks:
*  
   * Fixed crash that could occur when getting knock backed while wearing the energy shield backpack 
   * Fixed potential crash when a peer leaves with unique armor customization 
   * Various crash fixes 
*  
* Miscellaneous Fixes
*  
   * Fixed bug where helldivers wearing heavy armors would be immune to gas status effect 
   * General Brasch returns from holiday retreat in foggy hillside town 
*  
* Known Issues
* These are issues that were either introduced by this patch and are being worked on, or are from a previous version and have not yet been fixed.
*

   * Title may crash during intro cinematic or title screen 
   * Friends ""Invite only"" games can still be seen on the Galactic War Map but cannot be joined 
*  
* Medium Priority:
*  
   * Players are unable to shoot properly while in the air using a jetpack 
   * Stratagem balls bounce unpredictably off cliffs and some spots 
   * Some Eagle Stratagems may not drop when deployed on a swamp planet 
   * Reinforcement may not be available for players who join a game in progress 
   * Pelican-1 may sometimes be launched away if hit with an impaler tentacle 
   * Supply packs may be incorrectly used if pressing down on a controller while calling in a stratagem 
   * High damage weapons will not detonate hellbombs already present on the map

Back in my last year of high school (I went to school in Eastern Europe) it was customary to have mock exams before our actual baccalaureate/ final exams. These were not meant to be officially marked or taken super seriously, it was more of a practice for us to experience the exam setting while there wasn't much on the line. Some teachers took the mocks waaay too seriously though and even wanted to mark us based on how well we did in them. 
The Friday before the mocks I was going to the mall with some friends (my best friend was driving) when another novice driver t-boned our car at a roundabout. Basically my best friend lost his license for 2 months and since I didn't put a seatbelt on in the backseat I hit my head pretty hard against the car roof in the collision and I got a mild concussion. I say mild because I didn't faint but I had wild headaches for the next week or so. I spent 12 hours in the A&E because I wasn't an ""urgent"" case but they didn't want to let me go home without a proper checkup. I spent the following week home because I had the worst headache of my life combined with vertigo and fatigue so I was in no condition to write any exam. My mom called my head teacher and told her that I had a car accident and i will be recovering from a concussion and to share this with the other teachers in private so they all understand why I wasn't present at the mock exams. 
Now my head teacher couldn't be bothered to say anything and for the rest of the year I was hearing snide remarks and bullying from a couple teachers about how I wasn't there at the mocks. I only told them I was ill and couldn't attend them because I didn't want to make a big deal out of it in front of the class. 
The last straw was when my math teacher commented the week before my graduation that ""You still could have gone if you had a cold, it's not that serious of a reason to miss something important for your schoolwork."" 
I just looked back at her and said ""I never said I had a cold. I was in a car accident and I got concussed, I just didn't want to make a big deal out of it."" 
She got visibly embarassed and just stuttered about how she hopes I feel better now and that. As much as I didn't want the whole class to know about my brain damage it was satisfying to finally make that absolute Karen of a woman shut up. "

Second is in Shympur Bagnan AKA Howrah where many muslim have some problem with Visarjan and creating riots and attack on Hindus who are taking maa for Visarjan...

Third I heard from Falakata where they openly giving threats to Hindus to stop Durga Puja because they've problem by their faith.

Why they have so much power to openly giving threats, vandalism and many more. And many media channel is quiet. Bengali,Hindi or English,state or National no one .

When I arrived at the station, she messaged me saying she would be there in 5 minutes... and then blocked me on everything. 

I stood there confused, hurt, and in disbelief that someone could be so cold. I ended up spending the day in the city alone, trying to make the best of it, but I feel completely crushed. Why would someone do this? What should I do moving forward?"

About the recent Typhlosion memes.,1193,1g3s2p1,pokememes,https://i.redd.it/1s3c5726osud1.jpeg,81,1728943323.0,"It hasn't even been a week, and I'm already done with this joke.

It's one thing to have your Pokemon brandished as a tame sexual joke like Vaporeon, but pedophilia is an extremely serious matter that is traumatic for many who are or have been victims, and people are taking this way too far. There are already hundreds of thousands of posts on Twitter about it.

They're also brandishing ALL Typhlosions as sex offenders, both Hisuian AND Johtonian. Instead of just the one outlier who actually did the act. Which makes this all so much worse.

Pokemon used to be a safe place for me. It gave me comfort as an autistic child dealing with a fuckload of bullying and neglect. Pokemon made me feel good. Pokemon Gold and Silver were my absolute favorite games growing up, and Typhlosion was my favorite starter of the three. I wanted a Gen 2 anime SO BADLY, and when I saw Pokemon Chronicles do a 3-episode special with Ethan (Jimmy) and Typhlosion, i fucking lost my shit. I couldn't believe my eyes. Typhlosion and Ethan were on the TV screen and not just on my Game Boy.

But because of something that was created quietly by one of the devs which was never supposed to see the light of day and isn't even part of the canon got leaked to the public, I'm now going to have to hear that my favorite Pokemon is a fucking *sex offender.*

I'm *never going to hear the fucking end of it*. I'm *genuinely* in *tears* knowing that my favorite Pokemon is now going to be compared to the likes of actual fucking monsters that exist in our plane of existence.

After over 25 long years of playing this franchise, I'm so fucking close to just giving up and never coming back. This is actually so fucked up that you are all making jokes about all this."

After he installed the app he realised that he was on it since he had installed it, and my app was still uninstalled. So, I proposed a stupid bet of who could stay off Instagram the longest with a lapse on the bet on 31st December.

Honestly, this bet which I thought was stupid was the best decision of my life. It took me a week to control my urge to install the app but once I did everything changed.

1. My attention span improved drastically 

2. I don‚Äôt feel like I am missing out on something. Every time I saw someone post about a concert or a trip I left like I was wasting my life. Now I am much more content with how life is going.

3. I did replace Instagram with Reddit but my screen time for Reddit does not exceed more than 45 minutes a day whereas my Instagram time was 4-5 hours sometimes even 6 hours.

4. I don‚Äôt click pictures to post anymore but rather for memories to look back at, which has helped me live in the moment.

5. I am much more productive and my sleep schedule has also been fixed.

6. Now I don‚Äôt go for my phone the second I wake up.

I came to this realisation when I was sitting in my cab and the cab driver took out his phone to watch reels on a 30 seconds red light. 

I am so happy that my life is no more bound to a screen and I can actually enjoy and be content with my life. "

-I left an open space at the middle section to insert the portable monitor.
-I added slits on top of the side panels to put initiative order cards or other things.
-Wooden lasercut corners, D20 and name tag
More detailed pictures [here](https://imgur.com/a/dm-screen-2DBGxe8)

I was able to use all the woodwork tools for free at a local place after a friend told me how to use them. I enjoyed the whole process thoroughly so I'm thinking of building a DnD table for his 40th Bday.

I gave my boyfriend the portable monitor first. Unknowingly he opened the DM screen package. The picture is the moment he realized what it was.
I hope you like it!

She‚Äôs not a bad person, but she‚Äôs constantly in a state of chaos, and every little thing becomes my problem. No exaggeration, I get these ‚Äúemergency‚Äù calls multiple times a week. Flat tire? Call me at work. Forgot her wallet? Call me. Grocery store out of her favorite oat milk? Blow up my phone like the world‚Äôs ending.

It‚Äôs relentless. I work full-time and do my fair share at home with our son: diaper duty, bedtime stories, cooking, cleaning, you name it. But these ‚Äúcrises‚Äù are killing me. I‚Äôve told her before that unless it‚Äôs a real emergency, like someone bleeding or stuck on a highway at night, she needs to figure it out. I don‚Äôt have the bandwidth to drop everything constantly.

The last straw came two days ago. I had to take my son to the doctor because he had an ear infection, and I was already running on fumes. While I‚Äôm in the waiting room with a fussy toddler, she calls me in a panic because she locked herself out of her car in front of a Target five minutes from home.

I told her, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt leave. You‚Äôll have to call someone to pop the window.‚Äù She freaked out, saying that would cost too much, she didn‚Äôt bring enough cash, and I was being unreasonable. I stayed firm, said she needed to figure it out, and hung up.

When I got home later, she was furious. She said the guy charged her $150, and I should‚Äôve come to help because she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt think to grab her wallet.‚Äù I told her, point blank, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done rescuing you from things you can easily handle. You need to stop acting like everything is a disaster.‚Äù

Now she‚Äôs barely speaking to me, acting like I‚Äôm the villain for not dropping everything for her again. My brother thinks I was harsh, but my mom said I was right to set boundaries.

AITAH for leaving her stranded this time?"

I'm so sick of this - Canadian men,1626,1g3v68w,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1g3v68w/im_so_sick_of_this_canadian_men/,321,1728952224.0,"So obviously I'm Canadian.  We've always followed American trends, and it seems like proto facism is taking root here too. My brother has always been up my dad's ass - it's easy to idolize someone who was never there for the hard stuff. He's also a very accomplished businessman and is independantly wealthy. To my brother's eyes, this apparently means he is always right about everything, including his extreme far right views and all the times he disowned his kids being justified since he just ~has big feewingsü•∫~ 

But today at thanksgiving showed me something more concerning. I always knew my brother was a dumbass. But my young cousins have a very conservative father. My uncle point blank told me at a summer bbq I need to seek out conservative news sources as it's the only way to find the truth. This man is a LAWYER and said that exact sentence without a hint of irony to a woman who reads news from all sides so I know what's really cooking, y'know?  Now that context is established, let's get onto the bug in my ass. 

After hearing irritating conservative dogwhistles all night, culminating in calling our former highschool vice principal who is Nigerian AUNT JEMIMA, I lost control of my tight ""have a peaceful thanksgiving at all costs"" leash. And so I simply asked my foolish, ignorant brother if he was voting conservative. Granted, I tried to lean in and start a more private dialogue, but that sure didn't work out. I really shoulda just bit my tongue even harder. 

Him and my 16 year old (!!!) cousin jumped down my throat. I got called a retarded liberal. Got told I read too many liberal news sources. Got told Pierre Polievre (fuck him I refuse to spell check that scum's name) was not gunning for women's reproductive rights. That it was all just a big ugly liberal myth. All this in the span of maybe 30 seconds. As I tried to disengage ( again, my fault for even opening that pandora's box but Jesus h. Christ I truly wanted to know why he thought it would benefit society. Like I DONT GET IT NO ONE BENEFITS BUT COPORATIONS under conservative rule) I was literally seeing red. 

I AM SICK OF THIS SHIT. 

I AM SICK OF DEBATING THE REALITIES OF WHAT A FACT IS. 

I AM SICK OF OTHERWISE INTELLIGENT PEOPLE BURYING THEIR HEADS IN HATE BECAUSE IT'S EASIER. 

BEYOND IT ALL, I AM SICK TO DEATH OF MY RIGHTS AS A HUMAN BEING SO CASUALLY ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK BY MEMBERS OF MY OWN FAMILY. 

I truly cannot stand it anymore. They sounded like idiots to me - but the reason it made me so mad is that a dialogue was never an option. That a teen would think those thoughts, cleaarly parroted from a parent, and think they were good and intelligent. I'm not being cute when I say they're dangerous ideas. I'm so sick of this shit. 

To top it all off, my ""little"" cousin had some very hateful things to say about immigrants. Thing is, I was helping the little turdlet find a job at the resturant I work at. But since he lovesssss the conservative freemarket and hatttteeeessss immigrants and working with them so much, he can go throw his elbows out and struggle on his own. Maybe it makes me just as bad as them - maybe working alongside immigrants would expand his sense of empathy for the complexeties of the situation. But I simply can't be fucked to help someone who likely could never view me with respect. Who seems incapable of working alongside people who are even just a bit different to him. He can go into the so-called real world, pull himself up by his bootstraps and be a good old boy. 

My partner pulled me away - we already discussed why that doubled my upset. My anger is deeply rooted and highly justified. I DESERVE TO EXIST. WOMEN DESERVE TO BE EQUAL. LGBTQIA+ DESERVES TO BE EQUAL. When did safe, sane and consensual become such a difficult concept for society at large? 

Rant over. Thanks for coming to my ted talk. Canada is nearly as downhill as the states, and it's a damned shame.

I‚Äôve done a few playthroughs before but always kept the skeleton key and never rebuilt the thieves guild. I decided this time I would actually finish the quest line, and I‚Äôve been doing the small jobs for Delvin and Vex. But my goodness the way this is set up is so annoying!! 

They keep giving me jobs in Riften, which from what I‚Äôve seen online don‚Äôt count towards the bigger quest, and also keep giving me jobs in the cities I‚Äôve already finished the influence quest for. At this point I just need more small jobs in Solitude and Markarth but neither will give those to me! I keep quitting the jobs in other cities or reloading a previous save, but it doesn‚Äôt help. Not to mention having to go back and forth from the Flagon to the cities‚Ä¶

I wish this was set up like the small quests in the DB where you‚Äôre given a few marks to complete all at once and then you can go back for your reward. Why can‚Äôt I just choose a city to focus on, complete the 5 quests, then the influence quest and move on‚Ä¶ why is it so complicated??

Overall I love Skyrim and don‚Äôt mind how tedious it can be at times but geez this one‚Äôs a grind ü•¥"

This was posted to Superstonk here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/s/aSLS4IH8G3

On September 20th, CHWY is showing 9,400,626 FTDs.

There‚Äôs also an FTD spike a few days later on VB on September 26th, an ETF that holds both GME and CHWY. This makes sense if you believe they are using ETFs to delay settlement.

Had I not sought out this information I wouldn‚Äôt have it. This world where over-consumption feels like it‚Äôs at an all time high is pushed even more by educators deciding we didn‚Äôt need to learn how to sew. Taking the option of repair and making it more inaccessible. 

I watched as sewing machines were packed away. I listened to my teacher say that ‚Äúoh we used to do sewing/weaving but the school system doesn‚Äôt let us anymore. We tried arguing for it but to no avail‚Äù

The justification I was given when I asked why? 

Because it‚Äôs anti-feminist

No. Just no. What‚Äôs actually anti-feminist is this idea that stereotypical femininity is ‚Äúweak‚Äù or ‚Äúuseless‚Äù. This wretched thinking that the crafts of our forbearers cannot serve us in our modern day. Do not dismiss the strength and patience our mothers and grandmothers had to create something with their own too hands, it was for them their own unique power.

 Feminism is to be able to be taught whatever you want regardless of gender. It‚Äôs the freedom for a person to learn science and math and get a job in those fields ‚Ä¶and also to still sit by the loom if they so wish."

AITA for judging my husband after he introduced me to his friend‚Äôs mistress ,208,1g462d7,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g462d7/aita_for_judging_my_husband_after_he_introduced/,201,1728993994.0,"So me (25f) and my husband (30m) went out to dinner with this friend he‚Äôs always talking about and I didn‚Äôt got the chance to meet before.

Husband told me he‚Äôs married with kids, and he‚Äôs always inviting us out but we have kids too, I am a SAHM with no support system close by, so in order to go out we had to arrange child care.

I asked who‚Äôs coming to dinner and he mentions this friend and ‚Äúhis girl‚Äù, other couple that I do know and us.

Dinner was really nice, I had a great time and actually clicked immediately with this woman, most of my husband‚Äôs friends are bachelors so I found it cool that he‚Äôs friends with this couple I can relate more to, we even planned a trip during the dinner and they showed us all this amazing places they‚Äôve traveled to.

When is time to leave we all got out of the restaurant but she‚Äôs on the restroom, it‚Äôs freezing cold so we said bye and I told his friend ‚Äúsay bye to your wife, it was really nice to meet her‚Äù he looked at me, laughed and says ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not my wife‚Äù I am SHOCKED so I go like ‚Äúoh sorry my bad‚Äù 

We got in the car and I‚Äôm speechless, so my husband asks me what‚Äôs wrong and I asked him what was that about, isn‚Äôt she the mother of his kids? Is she basically his mistress? He explained to me that he‚Äôs on an arranged religious marriage so it‚Äôs different and ‚Äúthis is the girl he actually loves and takes everywhere‚Äù 

That doesn‚Äôt make me feel better at all cause a lot of our arguments are about me feeling like the trophy wife holding it down at home while he‚Äôs living his best life with his bachelor friends, I know at least other 2 friends of his that cheat openly on their wives the same exact way, and he always says he‚Äôs nobody to judge them, so I told him I just think is sh*tty that most of your friends play to have wifey at home taking care of the kids while they‚Äôre out living their best bachelor lives, and that if it was me the one always hanging out with cheater he would feel some type of way too.

I can honestly say I relate to my closest friends, they‚Äôre good woman with good values, I don‚Äôt see how I could hang out regularly with cheaters and woman I simply don‚Äôt relate to, so at this point I‚Äôm just not buying it that he‚Äôs the only one different in his friends circle.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being insecure, but I really feel stupid, and now he‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs upset because I ruined the night based on something that is out of his control and that he‚Äôs nobody to judge his friends personal life.

Tl:DR husband introduced me to his friend mistress on a dinner and the whole time I thought she was his wife and mother of his kids, I found out when we‚Äôre saying bye, got upset at husband cause with this is already a couple of his friends that I know cheat openly on their wives, and he got upset at me because that something out of his control and I‚Äôm judging him for somebody else actions.

AITA?"

In the new three-part documentary Anatomy of Lies, writer and producer Andy Reaser, a former colleague of Elisabeth Finch, the Grey's Anatomy writer and consulting producer who later confessed to having faked cancer, explains just how far Finch went to make her story believable.

""This was like performance art,"" Reaser says in the exclusive clip above. ""She was showing up to work with a shaved head and a, you know, a greenish hue. She looked like she lived in a microwave. She was eating these Saltines and drinking ginger ale and going to the bathroom to take puke breaks from her chemo.""

Reaser even heard talk that Finch had been looking at the medical props of the long-running Shonda Rhimes series.

This one is going to be the last one for a while now.

But my potato couldn't run Genshin and started acting up in a few months, also I was really bad at it so I stopped playing. 

When WuWa came, a friend told me that it's really fun and I should definitely give it a try since it works well on phone and I downloaded it around when Changli banner was about to end. I was still bad at it but my friend helped me so It was a better start than genshin for me. Still I didn't understand a lot of things and was too embarrassed to ask my friend but thankfully I found this sub and you guys have been just so kind and chill with explaining even the smallest details, and since then I've been improving a lot. 

I really like this sub and glad that it's not another place where people just spew hate to newbies for asking dumb questions. Mods are awesome and love the part that we do not sexualize child characters here."

My divorce was finalized a year ago. We had been separated for almost 2 years by then. I knew that we had to get divorced back in 2018. I remember the exact day that I realized I could no longer tolerate him. I spent all that time distancing myself financially and emotionally. I never cheated.

I could have started dating the day he moved out. I was so over the entire relationship. Does that make it cheating? How about a week, a month after separation? I waited a year before dating anyone, but I'm not gonna judge someone moving on quickly, as long as they are being honest about their situation. 

Walk-away wife syndrome makes it so much easier to move on quickly, since you have been emotionally removing youself from your spouse over a long period of time. Why don't more people realize this? Why can't they take responsibility for what really caused the separation? "

You can go out in the morning after Diwali and see many animals behaving like this, in shock. Last year I noticed this as well and I have never seen birds do this before.

[Mouths for letters](https://preview.redd.it/7umnrhtwtvud1.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ff8970ca8cde6e967677c5097cf6b4fc20b3e97)

See this? lets analyze and choose the correct mouth that Nayuta is shown with. Got one? thats right, the correct answer is the right mouth on the second row.

[mouth in question](https://preview.redd.it/pipjr7p0uvud1.png?width=189&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee8a633b1c083eaf6221b286b60ac1e1a79321a6)

This shows us that the word Nayuta last said ends with C,D,G,K,N,S,T,X,Y,Z.

Now before I show the last words of Nayuta lets see why many people don't like the death of Nayuta. Well, they mostly don't like it because it was an unsatisfying death of a beloved character of the fandom. 

Do you know who else sufferred this?

Thats right, if you take an unsatisfying death, and combine it with a beloved character in fandom.

I'm trying to get pregnant right now and I'm a stressed about mine and my husband's debt and how we will make this work but I want a family so so bad that I know we will figure things out. I'm 35 so I can't really wait any longer. I cannot FATHOM being a fucking millionaire with nannies and complaining about spending two whole days with the children I DECIDED TO MAKE. I've been on the fence with H3 for a while now, the content and the vibes have been so bad for a while now but this really pushed me over the edge. I guess I know why Hila has been on the show so much more, she just wants to get away from the kids. I get that it's really really hard but they have SO many more resources than about 99% of people with families. Also she said that shit loudly and online to thousands of people. Did she ever think her kids might see this one day? How would that make them feel. Did she ever think that some people in her audience are infertile or struggling to conceive? I would feel fucking blessed to be in their position, instead I'm worrying about having 1 kid because of my debt. I'm 35 and running out of time to start my family, god forbid I have complications or find out I can't conceive. I would be devastated. The entitlement is so strong with them I really can't watch another second. "

Okay‚Ä¶..I have exactly one previous play through where I had maybe hundred hours I remember unlocking oil and jetpacks at least‚Ä¶and this current playthrough I was at about 250 hours and about to set up Nuclear,  when I was watching a streamer play‚Ä¶..and I saw him‚Ä¶..just drag a part he didn‚Äôt need‚Ä¶.to the trash can icon‚Ä¶and my jaw dropped. I HAD BEEN FINDING SHITTY SINKS THE ENTIRE TIME TO TO GET RID OF SHIT. The fucking HOURS probably spent walking to a fucking virtual trashcan I thought was the only option‚Ä¶.what a fool I was‚Ä¶smh

Son of a BITCH. I honestly guess I never noticed it‚Ä¶or I pressed it like a button and it didn‚Äôt work.

And the inspiration for this thread, I just found out you can press spacebar to autocraft‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Even worse, the streamer I was watching was a coder, so I thought he was using macro or had a special mouse to do it‚Ä¶so I spent ANOTHER few weeks manually crafting before looking up about if its a macro or what and‚Ä¶I‚Äôm just now, sure enough as I‚Äôm typing this, autocrafting for the first time. GOD DAMNIT! Edit: Got like 200 miners in the time it took to type this on phone

AITAH for smashing my brother's phone after my nephew broke my TV and he said he would not replace it. ,5196,1g3k6j5,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g3k6j5/aitah_for_smashing_my_brothers_phone_after_my/,1440,1728923822.0,"Honestly the title says it all. 

My brother and his family were visiting our folks. I still live at home because I'm in an entry level job after college. 

I have a few gaming consoles that I keep in my room. My nephew was bored and he asked to play in my room. I said no, I would bring out my switch so he could play in the family room. 

My parents didn't want him making noise around everyone and they told me to let him in my room. 

He got mad playing and he threw the controller at my tv. It is destroyed. Big black line down one side. 

I grabbed him and dragged him to my brother. I told him what the little shit did. I said I wanted a new tv immediately. 

My mom said it was an accident but that's bullshit. My dad said that I could just replace it myself since I basically live at home for free. That's not the point. I didn't break it. 

My brother and his wife got mad that I manhandled their kid. My brother said he would not replace my TV and that I was lucky he didn't call the cops on me for child abuse. 

I called him an asshole and said he was going to replace my TV or there would be consequences. He said no. 

I grabbed his phone and much like Andy Samberg I threw it on the ground. It broke and that probably would have been fixable but it took a weird skip and went into the pool. 

Now everyone is mad at me for ruining the visit with my petty revenge. My brother had to go get a new phone and it cost probably four times what my TV will cost. 

I feel like I'm not the only person to blame. 

My nephew, brother, sister-in-law, and parents all helped cause the problem. I'm just the one catching hell for my actions. "

I am married to my republican husband of 23 years I was raised a dem and he has always been republican , it was never a consequential issue until Trump. If the topic gets brought up , I get so angry and we have had to resolve to not speak about it. We have 2 beautiful kids in college. A daughter , no less which makes me sick thinking he could be voting  against her rights. I want to check in and ask him if he really feels ok with this but it always goes straight to furry for me. I feel I am on the right side of history and respect all individuals to have the same rights and opportunitie. He is not your usual ignorant trump supporter that we visualize. He is a smart and kind man. He is not racist and always treats Me and all the women is his life with utmost respect. He is not religious , if anything he is atheist. I cannot wrap my mind around how he can support this sorry excuse for a man ame continue to vote for him despite everything. And I know most will say that he must be a closet racist or doesn‚Äôt respect women, but I know it‚Äôs not true. So what gives ? He is only supporting him bc he believes some of the lies and wants less government and truly believes he will do better financially under the Trump admin. if trump wins , I don‚Äôt think I can stay married to him bc I will feel so much resentment and anger. Do I dare hash this out again and tell him how I feel ? I love him and I love our family. He is a good man. I am so torn and this is what trump has done to our country and I am sick of it.

I‚Äôve seen some of the conversations about modding in Space Marine 2, and I wanted to introduce myself and explain a bit about my approach. I‚Äôm a professional game designer, and been involved in the modding community for a long time, working on projects like Sniper Elite and Sea of Thieves. More recently, I‚Äôve been responsible for most of the mods you‚Äôve seen for Space Marine 2, like Chaos Operators, the Operations Armoury Unlocker, Customisable Titus, and the recently released Kitbash (Screenshots above)

I love giving players more freedom to enjoy the game in new ways, but I‚Äôm really mindful of the impact mods can have. That‚Äôs why none of my mods affect PvP balance or give anyone an unfair advantage. You won‚Äôt find anything that buffs weapons to outshine the vanilla versions or breaks the experience for others. I‚Äôm trying to  focus on keeping things fair, while still offering more customization options and fun for PvE or single-player.

I‚Äôm always up for chatting about ideas, suggestions, or concerns you might have. Feel free to reach out here or on nexus mods‚ÄîI‚Äôm here to make the modding scene a great space for everyone!"

Now along comes the Plasma Purifier post buff with the same damage profile, in the same huge AOE hitting all the same break points (3 shot Alpha Commander, 1-2 shot Spewer, 1 shot everything else).  Except this time it has a 15 round mag up from a 5 round mag with 105 shots total up from 45. 

Just when you think it can't get better you can also mag dump uncharged shots at 1000 rpm to outperform the Plas-1 by leaps and bounds. Letting the gun double as an assault rifle. 

  
I was taking the Plasma Purifier with a supply pack and switching to the Mg-43 I took as well felt like a straight downgrade. This thing is straight up better than half the stratagem weapons in the game. "

I was M24 when I was at a Halloween party at an outdoor disco, I was dressed as a prisoner, with tattoos all over my body and wearing orange...in short, I was unwatchable.

I lose a bet with my friends and as a test I have to show my Clash of Clans village to some random girls. A friend of mine was supposed to film the scene.

I felt terrible that night, it was a constant going out because I was hot and coming in because I was cold, I was sweating cold and my stomach hurt, I almost felt like throwing up. I would have gladly gone home.

Back to the story, I go to these girls, I show my clash village, I'm being a little funny and one of these girls is playing along, she's not being a little shit looking at you, she's nice and very pretty. I win the bet and go back to my friends.

I go back to my friends to dance and while I'm dancing and while I'm hurting, I'm thinking about that girl -- to my friends I said, she was nice, she was playing along, she was pretty, I ask her for her number???

I go back upstairs and she and her friends were about to leave -- I stop her on the fly and say, I have the second part of the challenge, but this time it's personal, can I have your number? 

From there, we went out, got together and now we've been together for two years.

Ah there is another piece: when I wrote her on whatsapp (because she had given me the number), I sent her the screen of my clash of clans village asking her if she thought I should improve the cannons.

Ps: I used to play clash in middle school, now since I know her, I started playing it again and it's my favorite game. Thank you SUPERCELL."
"16 schoolchildren witness a cigar shaped UFO and occupants in Broad Haven, Wales 1977.",80,1g46kdq,UFOs,https://v.redd.it/ja8a7tx8zwud1,13,1728995515.0,"A flying saucer seen by a guest house, a 7ft alien-like figure coming out of a hedge and a ""cigar-shaped"" UFO near a school yard.

These are just some of the 450 reported alien encounters from one of the UK's largest mass sightings in a remote Welsh village.

The village of Broad Haven has since been described as the ""Bermuda Triangle"" of mysterious craft sightings and sightings of strange beings.

""The spaceship looked like a cigar shape with a dome on it with yellowy, orange to red light on the top of it,"" one child told BBC cameras at the time.

Another child said he didn't just see a UFO, adding: ""I saw a man, but I couldn't see its face because it was too far away.""

Now more than 45 years later, those 10-year-olds who reported the strange sights during lunchtime at Broad Haven primary school still insist this was no childish hoax.

David Davies, 57, said he was initially sceptical when his school friends rushed back into class from the playground claiming to have seen a spaceship.

""I totally regarded the story as being nonsense as to me flying saucers didn't exist,"" he said. ""They were in bad 1950s sci-fi movies or in tabloid newspapers.""

Expecting to dismiss the fuss as just kids telling tales, he went out to see for himself - and still remains stunned as to what he said he witnessed.

""From behind some trees, this thing popped up in front of me,"" he said.

""It was silver, cigar-shaped and about 45ft long and there was just this thought that came into my mind that I had to run away.

""Mothers can tell when you're lying and [mine] was absolutely convinced what I was saying was the truth.""

The pupils were asked to draw and write an account of what they saw on their return to school by school headmaster Ralph Llewhellin, who separated the children to ensure there was no copying.

""It's not like today, there was no social media or mobile phones so there was no opportunity to have collaborated,"" David said.

Mr Llewellyn later told the BBC's children's current affairs show John Craven's Newsround that all the descriptions were ""similar"".

This case shares striking similarities between the Ariel School UFO incident in Ruwa, Zimbabwe in 1994 and the Westall UFO incident in Melbourne, Australia in 1966.

I worked out the script and FLY are mathematically unable to lose to GENG (satire),95,1g45mq4,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1g45mq4/i_worked_out_the_script_and_fly_are/,10,1728992491.0,"Look at the members of FLY.

2 members of flyquest are rookies. These players do not affect the maths.

Quad was briefly a streamer for Geng. He knows their strategies, and so he will be in Chovy's head.

FLY Inspired used to play for Rogue. Rogue took a game off DRX in 2022. DRX beat OK Brion. We know that the Bros are incredibly strong, and on that team is lord Morgan. Lord Morgan has played alongside Chovy on HLE previously, and so we can only assume is just as good as Chovy. That team was only able to make it to the quarter finals of worlds before being knocked out. So, logically Inspired is better than Chovy and so will make it further than the quarters.

FLY Bwipo is the easiest one to look at. World finalist, and in 2020 he took 2 games off TES in quarter finals of worlds. Well TES beat T1 this worlds. T1 have consistently shown that they are better in international events than GENG, winning worlds as 2nd seed last year and making finals the year before. Also, T1 beat HLE 2-0 in spring. HLE obviously beat GENG in finals, when it mattered most. Thus we can conclude that TES is better than GENG. Sure TES lost to GENG in swiss, but as we all know, bo1s dont matter.

Thus, Bwipo's 2 games against TES and Inspired beating DRX once is 3 games won. That means that FLY will win 3 games against GENG. Also, as both of these reasonings occur within the quarter finals (Chovy on HLE losing in quarters, and Bwipo beating TES in quarters) we know that these wins are occuring in quarter finals, and do not refer to their swiss stage wins.

Nice script riot but I've worked it out."

Update: AITA for breaking up with my fiancee for telling her best friend she was not engaged? ,5344,1g3ihxn,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g3ihxn/update_aita_for_breaking_up_with_my_fiancee_for/,359,1728919646.0,"Hey guys, I just got home after talking to my (still) ex-fiancee, and since a lot of people asked for an update, here it is. But, I want to clarify a few things.

As commented on my original post, I pay for the house since I bought it before dating her and I asked her to move in, since it was close to her job. I work from home since I'm in tech, but she had to go to work, that's why I paid for her car, to help her commute (and honestly her salary is shit). I was her partner, so I didn't see any problem with that. I thought she was the one, despite everything, she is smart, funny, we had chemistry, but I felt betrayed.

To the update.

We met at a coffee shop on the premise we would discuss how to save our relationship, at least, that's what she thought. As soon as we sat down, I asked to see their messages. She got defensive immediately and told me she had deleted everything. I asked to see her phone anyway. She started to cry, ugly cry, asking me to stop. At that point I had already decided I was not going to be part of the relationship anymore, but damn, I was curious. It took a good 20 minutes for her to hand me her phone, a lot of crying, even a waitress asking her if she was ok.

So I read the messages. There wasn't any cheating like nudes being exchanged, them professing their love for each other, but what I read still stung. There was a lot of shit talking about me. A LOT. Texts and texts of them saying how terrible of a person I was, criticizing my hobbies (i like video games and pro wrestling) saying I wasn't a real man because of them and stuff like that. But there where two topics that caught my eye. One where she had told him I was having trouble getting hard and that was frustrating for her. And one where she was complaining about how she didn't want to be ""stuck"" in our relationship.

Yes, I was having problems in bed... because I was sad because my father had passed away (6 months ago) and the ""stuck"" thing, I remember telling her that when we got married, IF SHE WANTED she could leave her job, and I would provide for both of us. I don't know if she took this the wrong way, but I guess it was related to that. I honestly don't know.

By the time I gave her the phone back, she was already giving excuses on why she was saying those things to him, how he was like a ""therapist"" for her, and then she asked me ""don't you complaing about me to your friends?"" and I simply replied ""no, I don't"". She started crying again. I took a pretty deep breath and just said ""just give me the ring back"" (I didn't had the ring with me, like some suggested). She hesitated a bit, but gave it to me anyway. I stood up and asked her to delete my number and to not bother me anymore.

I called her mom and asked her to pick up her daughter's stuff at my place. Her mom is a good person, I'm just realizing I'm going to miss her as I write this. She understood why I decided to end it, but she didn't asked much, and to be honest, I'm glad she didn't. As for my mom, I didn't called her, I just blocked her for things unrelated to this post, I just realized she never had my back in anything, I was always trying to save an already failed mom-son relationship.

Before I leave, I just want to clarify. I was never against her having male friends, or any type of friends. People are going to cheat, friends or no friends. I remember my dad saying something to me when I was a teenager, he always said ""opportunity makes the thief"", but I do not agree with that. Anyway, since I have the next two weeks off work, I going to figure what to do with the wedding money, drink some booze, play games and watch Monday Night Raw later.

Peace.

PS: sorry for any typos, but I fixed the title now.

Edit: a couple of people are asking about the car. Is a 2015 Nissan Versa which she crashed 2 times, both times she rear ended someone. Never liked the car, weak engine, the interior feels cheap and overall bad, so for all I care she can keep that piece of shit. I would have more luck throwing it off a cliff than selling it.

Edit 2: Little update. Her mom called me a few hours ago to check on me and to ask when she could come and pick up ex's stuff. We spoke about the car and she basically ""forbid"" me to let her daughter keep the car because: 1 - I paid for it. 2 - Ex wouldn't be able to maintain it. So I'm going to keep the car until I'm able to sell it (god help me). 

Also, some people called the story fake, cause they said I wasn't a ""real man"" for playing games, and yet they played WoW. To be honest, that's on me, cause I wasn't very clear. The ""real man"" thing was more about the pro wrestling hobby than the gaming hobby, but in some messages they clearly mocked me for playing some games (Life is Strange Series) in one I remember James saying something like ""How could a grown ass man play such a girly game and cry?"" Yes, I cried playing Life is Strange. I also cried to RDR2 (the I'm afraid cutscene still makes me emotional). I'm a crybaby I guess.

Also I want to thank everyone who message me to talk about wrestling and games, it really helped me take my mind out of everything. I haven't replied to everyone, but I intend to. If anything happens, I'll let you guys know. Be good people."

I have to clarify that this account is not mine but instead from a Limbus Company player minmaxer that I've recently and currently following. The name is **NITAMAGO√∏l22**.

The way that this player have achieved this high battle pass level in a short amount of time is by doing MD4 normal. The player has been doing this for 20-21 hours every single day (yes I know, it's completely mental and amazing)

The 2 comps that the player used:

1. Burn Team with the use of Glimpse of Flame (you get it by crafting) **low starlight**
2. Hard Defense Team with the use of Thrill (you simply use Defense skills but this needs to have **high Starlight** in order to get Thrill every run)

There is an in-depth guide through this strat, it can be found on his/her Account on Twitter. [NITAMAGO](https://x.com/NITAMAGO0l22/status/1843587059119992960) (Just use Google translate and follow the Starlight paths, as for the Burn team, it makes your chances of getting the tier 4 gift Glimpse of Flame higher)

On the Burn team, the average run would be **12-15 mins.**   
On the Hard Defense team, the average run would be **17-20 mins.**  
(There are videos of NITOMAGO posted doing these runs)  
I hope this is beneficial to someone who wants to grind Mirror Dungeon 4 as much as possible. If you read up to this point, I am currently distorting because of grinding MD4 and my Midterms. Please be advised to grind responsibly. May Carmen save you all."

In the past I always thought being free to play is completely fine and a player choosing not to spend anything or unable to spend anything can be just as goood as someone who is paying for the game. This is propably true for older free to play accounts but since the release of hero equipment the hurdle for free to play got a LOT higher. 

The builder cost is fine and has always been there, you can get 3750 gems in a few weeks with the early achievements. But then there is 9000 gems worth of hero equipment in the store right now (which long time players essentially got for free). After the current event another 1500 gems will be added to this mountain. Looking at this as a new player must feel absolutely terrible. Sure you can argue you don't need all the equipment but then supercell is going around doing balance patches and suddenly you need different equipment. And this is ignoring the other problem of getting all the ores required to upgrade them which is a whole other issue. 

  
My suggestion to solve this problem is: raise the raid medal cap to 10k and offer hero equipment for 10k raid medals. It doesn't even need to be all the equipment, maybe it can be on a weekly rotation which equipment is being sold. Just give us a way other tham gems to earn it."

Since then polls have been underestimating democrats, and now we have Harris/Walz who are both way more popular than Biden. The pollsters and news have a vested interest in making the election seem close to get you to click their articles or go look at their poll.

My emblem was rejected in like January. i didnt really care until I saw this auto-generated trash in the game.

I actually told my other clan members it might get rejected because it could be too close to the shonen jump logo. 

I think too many people see this as a complaint about my emblem not being accepted and not about the fact that DE accepts AI clan emblems. THAT is what I dont like. I can make a better clan emblem. They had a good enough reason to reject mine. But i think they ALSO have good reason to reject obvious AI as well.

But as far as AI goes, my position is that it is stealing. It's always been stealing, and people who can't draw should get over it, like everyone else who gets over things they can't do. And yeah, I wont accept the argument that it isn't stealing. I dont need an echo chamber to validate me. I see a lot of people in the replies defending AI. I still think they are wrong, even though I read their comments.

ETA: It is genuinely disappointing that so many Warframe players are cool with AI. But what do I expect from a community who spends a not-insignificant amount of their time in trade chat writing ""WTB big titty goth mommy.""

-‚Äê-------‚Äê---------------------------------------------------------------------

Soooo... my clan emblem is rejected because I hand drew my own version of the Shonen Jump font, but AI generated clan emblems are okay? Wtf DE? And there is no excuse. Both of these emblems are obviously AI. You can go look for yourself right now, they're FEATURED. Must be nice. And I dont get my 150 plat back, either. Sick. Also, I'm fairly sure the font used for Shonen Jump is creative commons like most other fonts. If it isnt, is it copyright infringement to use it for a parody clan (Ronin Jump)? I doubt it.

Just wanted to share the complete idiocy that happens at my workplace.

My boss was working in an Adobe Acrobat file and, as the owner of the business, spends many hours working late as well. I had already left for the day and he was still working on an important Adobe file late at night. Of course, he ran into an issue where the file crashed, and upon reopening it, none of his work saved. 

He was furious over this and then reached out to our IT team for help. They‚Äôre supposedly a 24 hour service, but they didn‚Äôt do anything to help out that night.

Come the next morning and I see all the emails regarding this matter. It was supposedly up to me to call the IT company to handle it, even though that was never explicitly outlined.. plus, he had already alerted them of the issue the night before. I didn‚Äôt call right away as I was trying to sort out the situation first, and my boss got mad at me for not handling it right away. Long story short, the IT team wasn‚Äôt able to help because the file was never saved, so they couldn‚Äôt recover the lost information. He kept arguing with them as if it was their fault though.

So, I basically got reprimanded for my boss‚Äô stupid mistake of not being able to save a PDF file. Meanwhile, i‚Äôve told him countless times before that you have to save Adobe Acrobat files manually. He just doesn‚Äôt seem to listen I guess. 

My boss makes ridiculous money annually, I‚Äôm guessing well over six figures. Just goes to show you don‚Äôt really have to be that intelligent to be rich lmfao. "

This guy (28) told me  (f29) a a party just after a first date that went pretty well that he has a foot fetish and enjoys shibari and has cords at his place. At the party (it was at my place, he is my new roommate's close friend) he seemed a bit controlling too, tried to make me drink more and slapped my butt (like an old couple kinda). All of that is the opposite of what I like, ( I have a lot of sexual trauma and can't enjoy violent sex play of even just a dominant partnee) I told him I need some time to gather my thoughts before seeing him again and he keeps texting me since I said that. 
The guy is definitly making me feel anxious, I just realized I don't have a lock on my door, he is often invited at my place, I can't really sleep but feel like I am exaggerating. I guess it's a gut feeling? 
How to tell him to leave me alone without risks of .. i don't even know the risks. I feel trapped in this situation today. 
Oh and we are supposed to go to a concert next week for date 2. 

Thank you so much if you have some advice. Is this just anxiety?

Ich glaube Einige hier m√ºssten sich bei Joe entschuldigen.,122,1g454zf,7vsWild,https://www.reddit.com/r/7vsWild/comments/1g454zf/ich_glaube_einige_hier_m√ºssten_sich_bei_joe/,68,1728990670.0,"Das wird einigen jetzt nicht schmecken, aber ich kann mich erkl√§ren:



TL;DR am Ende. Dieses Jahr habe ich online quasi alles rund um 7 vs. Wild gemieden‚Äîsei es dieses Subreddit oder Posts auf Instagram oder TikTok, die mir trotzdem immer wieder in meine Timeline gesp√ºlt wurden.

Der Konflikt begann damit, dass Stefan nicht zu einer Feier (?) von Joey eingeladen wurde. Die einzige Person, die sich dazu √§u√üerte, war Joe Vogel, der vermutete, man habe Stefan vergessen, und dadurch zur Zielscheibe wurde. Dass m√∂glicherweise Joey ein Problem mit Stefan hatte (oder warum alle anderen Teilnehmer schwiegen), wurde nicht thematisiert - ersteres wird aber aktuell immer klarer.

Joe bekam bereits viel Kritik ab und versuchte schlie√ülich, das Ganze zu begraben und bat alle, auf die Ausstrahlung der Folgen zu warten, um sich selbst ein Bild zu machen. Daran hielt sich niemand, und er wurde weiter angefeindet. Mit Beginn der Folgen wurde krampfhaft versucht, ihn schlecht darzustellen: Er redet nett √ºber die Frauen‚Äî""Joe der Chauvi und Sexist""; er kritisiert Stefan‚Äî""Mobbing"" etc.



Dass das Ganze vielschichtiger und nicht so eindimensional war, wird gerne √ºbersehen. Auch wird ignoriert, dass er von allen anderen Teilnehmern gemocht wird‚Äîdie keinen Hehl daraus machen, dass er Ecken und Kanten hat, weil er weitschweifig redet oder manchmal impulsiv handelt.



Es wird so getan, als w√§ren es ""zwei Experten, die sich streiten und die Gruppe spalten"", aber ich sehe einen ""Experten"", der Feedback der Gruppe annimmt und interagiert, und einen, der spaltet.



So entstand das Narrativ des Meistermanipulators. Es ist seltsam zu glauben, dass eine Gruppe junger, erfolgreicher und selbstst√§ndiger Leute nicht in der Lage w√§re, Komplimente von Manipulationen zu unterscheiden. F√ºr Influencer ist das eine Kernkompetenz, um nicht von ""falschen"" Freunden oder Managern ausgenutzt zu werden. Ihr k√∂nnt euch sicher sein das eine Julia, Sandra, Uwe Hugo etc. da vermutlich mehr Kompetenz haben (m√ºssen), als die Keyboard-Warrior hier. 



Auch jetzt, wo Stefan durch sein Verhalten die Gruppe in Gefahr gebracht und sich selbst entlarvt hat, suchen einige weiterhin die Schuld bei Joe. Es ist sogar auf Kamera festgehalten, wie Stefan sich beschwert, dass die Gruppe (und Joe) gesagt haben, er solle kein Heuerfolz trocknen, und wie beleidigend die Gruppe sei‚Äîobwohl sie ihn nur offen und direkt kritisiert hat. Trotzdem macht er es, setzt das Lager in Brand, ist passiv (""Uii, ein Feuer, keine Ahnung wie das hier hingekommen ist, lol"") und schiebt die Schuld auf die anderen, die verst√§ndlicherweise ver√§rgert reagieren.



Versteht mich nicht falsch, ich glaube, das ist reine psychologische Abwehr und Verleugnung‚Äîweil man nicht wahrhaben will, was nicht wahr sein darf. Vor allem wenn selbst man schon so lange Joe als den b√∂sen und Schuldigen identifizieren konnte. 



H√§tten viele dieser Leute einfach mal abgewartet, anstatt voreilige Schl√ºsse zu ziehen und Joe als Narzissten und Manipulator darzustellen, w√§re die Stimmung hier sicherlich nicht so schlecht.



TL;DR: Einige sollten einfach mal durchatmen, bevor sie aus der Ferne Diagnosen stellen und jemanden als Manipulator und Narzissten framen. Mir ist klar, dass das nicht passieren wird, aber er h√§tte von euch eine Entschuldigung verdient.

However, some of the voice lines in the game tend to be rather mumbled, especially if you're playing on 2x speed for every battle.  

Don't get me wrong, for epic fights, I slow it down to hear the fabu music, but I digress.

With that in mind, what voicelines do you always mishear?  For me, the main one is Acheron's ultimate.  After she's done cutting up everything on the screen, she sheathes her sword and mutters,

""It tastes like foam.""

This DOES sound in line with how she can't taste most foods anyway, but I'm fairly positive that's NOT what she's saying."

Asmongold - ""Our culture is literally just better sorry not sorry."" ""But Palestine isn't under alien invasion though."" ""I don't think they (Palestinians) will get around and let gay people do whatever they want (based??)"", ""\*rolls eyes\*"" (Oh god Asmon mentioned Muslim immigrants trying to change laws in Europe here we go), ""If I go down the street in Texas, you know, all the names are in Spanish. And the people are there."", ""Thank god we have American Culture to keep this (killing gay people) In check."",""I think looking at people through statistics is dehumanizing, you should look at actions of the leaders (Hasan answers with ""b..b.b.bbut.. I rate it on a curve...)"", ""Understandable bad behavior is in fact still bad behavior. (holy based)""

~~Hamas~~Abi - ""Bro but eugenics and settler colonialism!"", ""I talk to gay people in the region **all the time**"", ""They are busy with thinking 'I want cookies sometimes'"". ""Of course, I care about queer liberation!"", ""Its not because I grew up in Turkey or in a Muslim country (holy shit the shapeshifter is back!"" LITERALLY LIKE 2 MINUTES LATER ""You and **I** were born in America (HUH)"", ""Q - but you do see as some cultures as inferior right? Like conservatism? A - no, I don't consider any culture inferior. I consider conservatism... wrong. It is **inferior** to me."",""I consider it unproductive to think of how the dominated people resist the power, ultimately, while they resist a dominating power **it doesn't matter**"", ""Can you fault the Palestinians for **celebrating 9/11?**"", ""(with a smile in his voice) I wouldn't really blame victims of a genocide for getting a little bit of enjoyment for the deaths of civilians of their oppressors (Jesus fucking Christ)"", ""As a matter of fact, Jews did cohabitate the space during the Ottoman Empire, without much resistance or trouble at all"" (ISRAEL IS BASICALLY A STATE WE DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED AND USE TO DISH OUT VIOLENCE IN THE REGION IM DYING BRO)

Absolute KINO. Twitch Politics greatest warriors.

Edit: It's unironically gold bros, the arguments flying around are crazy, and seeing Hasan HOLDING himself back to not devolve into his usual screeching is so fucking satisfying lmao. Hasan knows Asmongold is far too big and he is far too cowardly and optics-brained to ever risk it.

Updates over, going to sleep, praying for D-Man to react to this, and talking to Asmon to clear up the bullshit Hasan spewed."

Is the game actually easy and I'm just a terrible player?,907,1g3wnq9,HonkaiStarRail,https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/comments/1g3wnq9/is_the_game_actually_easy_and_im_just_a_terrible/,458,1728956736.0,"Seeing people saying they auto'd MOC 12 with Hoolay and got immediate 3 star first try on 0-3 cycles while I was struggling clinging to hope as my Firefly and Feixiao teams (two meta teams that are supposed to excel in this cycle) barely cleared it in 6 cycles total played manually after many resets.. I feel like I'm doing things wrong here and I can't point out what. People say meta characters are not needed, that they can still clear with Jing Yuan, Seele, or hell even Yanqing or Clara with 3 cycles with the same supports I have while I cleared it in 8 cycle in one side. I struggled to hell and back every endgame cycle with meta teams and limited 5 star characters as a day one player meanwhile we got F2P one month olds already 0 cycling with 4 stars.. well that was an exaggeration but still. I am basically forced to metaslave because of how hard the game keeps getting. I guess I can understand why I'm more worried about powercreep than most of the peeps in this sub. 

How do you guys reach to this point? What sort of routine do you guys do on the daily that differs from mine? Mind sharing your secret on how to git gud?"

Really excited for this overall. I have been wanting to submit cards more regularly for grading but it's too expensive when you consider the minimum card limit. This and not needing to spend time with submission documents is awesome. For anyone concerned about the process, PSA already has a great app that lets you scan raw cards to input them into a submission. Should make for a relatively straightforward process for GameStop employees. "

https://preview.redd.it/bguefo0etwud1.png?width=1843&format=png&auto=webp&s=16c916d2c8ad325d898e62ae7fa6d1196b6e368b

As promised during yesterday's post, I've begun my research into a forecast on our price movement over the course of our next options cycle and accordingly shifted some of my gaze into larger perspectives. Whereas in prior weeks and months, I've talked about the end of our technical paradigm concluding sometime at the end of October or beginning of November, I've come to suspect that the paradigm will be transforming in a different way than I previously projected - and that it is actually ending as of this week. Today's discussion is going to involve a little more TA than usual, but I think it's important to draw our attention to these patterns as we try to piece together what we can expect in the possible coming of a 2021 requel. We'll start small Let's take a look. 

**Price Movement Recap**

Yesterday's trading day started off with a fake-out dip on some light volume likely in acknowledgement and expectation of our continued recovery trend into 10/18 OPEX. Bearish trades shot the price down just below $20.50 - last week's floor - and allowed bearish traders the opportunity to cash out on long puts and short calls while setting up to take advantage of yesterday's recovery action. 

[10\/14 Trading Day 1-min Aggegation](https://preview.redd.it/m7rk9f95lwud1.png?width=1582&format=png&auto=webp&s=8803c14baf1099f025897c78cc7e536084048ec4)

At around 10:45am EDT the price slowly started to walk up towards the VWAP +1 Standard Deviation line. Right as it reached this territory, some volume suddenly picked up and shot the price up before bearish traders attempted to take advantage of a big RSI overbought signal - but this was a trap.

In the span of a half hour, 1.2 million shares of bullish volume poured in and shot the stock price up all the way $21.67 - $0.02 shy of our 50-day SMA and the technical upper bound on our week to week trading channel. The stock price reversed back to VWAP where traders picked up a small oversold signal to return the stock price to the 200-min moving average where things looked to rest into the end of the day before some large bullish options orders took us on another small run up to $21.50, before settling into the close.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

Although Max Pain is still at $20, we saw a huge expansion of Call OI and contraction of Put OI and short Call OI heading into October OPEX (necessarily Bullish):

[10\/18 OPEX OI Changes 10\/14-10\/15](https://preview.redd.it/wbtylsux6xud1.png?width=1867&format=png&auto=webp&s=de9cafd2ca70e5a00b42a332a36323094a9337cd)

Plenty of this Call Volume was bearish. However, net flows were bullish on the day and, crucially, $21.50 has filled in with a large volume of Calls at the ASK. With $21 and $22 as substantial levels of OI, this is shaped to enable potential gamma runs across that range and up to $22 throughout week.

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/tu41dqgr7xud1.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=02b8fac5034a45e98b6dfbeee9e6deddcb179919

Put GEX has evaporated below $20 and Call Gamma forms a thick, stable range up even through $23 ($22.50 is a little light on OI, but this could change). If options flows stay bullish and consistent, stock price recovery can easily grind its way up throughout the week or be set up for something upward and dynamic late week depending on price positioning ahead of this. Major downside volatility risk is minimal at this point.

**Technicals**

Okay, everyone, we've been looking at the daily chart since mid-July for three full months now here at Open Interest - the whole of Q3. We've also been looking at my doodle projection for exactly one month and it has indeed played out (with some infelicities) according to my projection back before September OPEX. Throughout this Q3 timeframe, we've seen a technical paradigm establish itself and largely find respect and valuation amid traders and institutions over that timeframe. How do I know that? If they didn't, I would not have been able to predict the time, duration, and extent of day-to-day and week-over-week price reversals across that timeframe with any degree of statistical significance. There would also be a much poorer man standing before you.

But the real question for is, as I posed in yesterday's post, this: what is going to happen next? Just because I've gotten the past few months right, this doesn't mean I'll get the next few months right. I am, after all, just some guy. For this, we're going to have to zoom out a bit and take a look at our price action not only through daily, but weekly aggregation periods.

As I mentioned above, you'll recall that I expected our technical paradigm - a trading channel formed by the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages - to come to a close late this month or early next month. I hypothesized that this would occur as a result of the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA meeting around that time.

I still believe that our technical paradigm will end at that time. However, **I no longer believe it will end as a result of the convergence of these two moving averages.**

Let me explain. Here is a chart of our price action leading up to and since Sneeze 2.0:

https://preview.redd.it/8mfor31z0xud1.png?width=1487&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4665463e35a28278ce8426dfe7b5dc38125334b

Since our double-top pattern back in May and June, GME has been in a bear trend. For awhile, this trend consolidated above the 50-day SMA likely as MMs internalized DFV's June share purchase and closed their FTDs leading up to July 16 when the price peaked at $29.99. At this point, however, GME slipped into a new paradigm and traded all the way down to the 200SMA where it found support amid the Nikkei crash on Aug 2. Since then, GME has tested the 50SMA several times as a resistance and retested the 200SMA (with a rising floor) transposed up by $1 as a result of the Q3 ATM cash infusion. 

Technically, Aug 2 is an important date. Why? Aug 2 is exactly 50 trading days prior to today. Why does this matter? This day is the 2nd lowest daily mean value in the past 90 trading days. All but one of the trading days before it and all of the trading days since it have higher average values. What this means, then, is that as we move forward in time the 50SMA will no longer be moving down, but begin to move UP in value on our daily chart. In addition to this, the stock price on our last downward test of the 200SMA could not log an average daily value of anything lower than $20.50.

At the same time, our 200SMA will continue to move up. With each passing day, daily price values of $10, $11, $12 are removed from the average value calculation while values of $20+ are added to the average. This pattern projects to continue until Sneeze 2.0 values are outside the calculation window of 200 trading days, or approximately 95 trading days from today.

This trend largely corresponds with our 50-week SMA in the following chart where we find our SMAs inverted:

https://preview.redd.it/giih4ogj4xud1.png?width=1584&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a8a9436c33d11cd078fdef27bfbbf22883bdc8d

Here we can see the 50-week SMA begin to make a slow curl up as it approaches the $20 price level. Currently its calculations extend back into November of 2023 where average weekly price levels were much lower than they are now. This, too. projects a continued uptrend in this technical level for the next 28 weeks or \~140 days. 

What this means from a technical perspective, is that our current trading channel need not close over the next few weeks, but rather that it will begin on the whole to slowly curl upward. Although our highs have been lower over Q3, our lows have become progressively higher by about $1 per month. 

While these are merely technical indicators and not mechanically binding, so far, they have corresponded to psychological respect on the part of the options market over the past three months. Whether that will continue is a matter for our observation. If this respect does continue, then GME will be entering into the set up for a bullish trend out into Q1 of 2025 which begins essentially now.

**IV Trends**

**Synthesis¬†+ TA;DR**

Our mild recovery this week to the upside has room to run and the market appears to have the will to let it continue based on yesterday's options activity. In technical dimensions, it looks like our technical paradigm will not so much expire, but transform from a consolidating, narrowing trading channel into an upward trending channel into Q1 2025 for the next 100 days or so. This may not be dramatic at first, but does promise to be consistent with higher lows soon to be accompanied by higher highs as well. We'll have to observe our upcoming options activity over the next few weeks to determine whether traders intend to continue to put credence in these factors - and whether a certain feline friend may have two cents to put toward the question... 

Good luck out there!

Cheers

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER:¬†These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I never hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight."

For many years I‚Äôve been waking and baking daily. War in my home country, sick and old parents back home, living alone, stress from work, mental illness etc. I could afford it and it seemed to help with stress so I never thought it to be a big deal as long as I can do my job. The reason to quit wasn‚Äôt so noble either, I saw how much more expensive weed has gotten in dispensaries and thought it‚Äôs just not worth the money considering how high my tolerance has become. 
So I quit cold turkey and that same week ended up at the psych emergency ward because no one ever has warned me there‚Äôs such a thing as weed withdrawal. In my mind and from what I‚Äôve seen in pop culture it‚Äôs just a nasty but mostly harmless habit. The first week of withdrawals I was feeling so awful I had to call the suicide hotline (at least twice) for the first time in my life. I‚Äôm still battling alcohol addiction which I already talked to a professional about and will hopefully receive proper help with that too because that one is much harder to battle on your own, at least for me. 
I haven‚Äôt felt any cravings or desire to buy any weed and the bong and the grinder have been stored away. 
I don‚Äôt have anyone but for my bff who supported me through this to whom I‚Äôm eternally grateful. I wish people were more informed how prolonged use of weed does get you addicted even though it‚Äôs not as obvious as alcohol cravings and just how severe the withdrawals can get after long time use. My throat feels much better. It‚Äôs still very hard to get through each day but I am month ago I didn‚Äôt thing I‚Äôd be at this point even. So if anyone can send a single cheer I‚Äôd appreciate it so much. Sending love to everyone who‚Äôs battling addictions. Thanks for reading. "
