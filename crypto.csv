Post,1gpphzp,,MoonWeek,"Hello everyone and welcome to Moon Week for round 55 of Moons! For more information about Moons, please [see our wiki page here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki). 

We are using Snapshot for voting directly with the Moon balance in your wallet, in a transparent and open manner. For now all Moons held in self-hosted wallets at the time of poll creation will be eligible to vote, so if you are holding Moons on an exchange, the telegram TipBot or in a wallet that you are not comfortable connecting to snapshot then please be sure to transfer your Moons to a self-hosted wallet that you are comfortable connecting to snapshot before each Moon Week. 

To give exposure to our governance polls for the month, this Moon Week post will remain pinned to the top of the subreddit until next Monday. You can [see our schedule here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=i0e5as6q033nruqck5c9nfk24k%40group.calendar.google.com).**Please review the following important information first:**

* Successful polls are implemented whenever the responsible party has a chance to do it. Usually this is within days or weeks of the poll passing, but depends on workload, priorities, and complexity of implementation. You can look at implementation status on [the CCIP list.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LhhqB4UAezNMdAwjV3evFXPD2x1JFCFHdnm8rmyRqAE/edit?usp=sharing)
* In the event of incompatible polls passing, the poll with more Moons voting in favor will be considered the winner and the other will not be implemented.

The goal is to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve of 1 million Bitcoins, held for at least 20 years. The bill faces political challenges but has bipartisan support and could be prioritized by a future Republican-controlled Congress.

>Technically speaking, Okung is still being paid in fiat. Behind the scenes, however, is Lightning Network magic: Strike receives a direct deposit from his team, the Carolina Panthers, and then swaps dollars for bitcoin. That bitcoin is then sent to a cold storage wallet held by Okung, Mallers said. (To recap, Lightning is a secondary system for sending bitcoin in a cheaper and quicker fashion compared to using the Bitcoin network itself.)

Even if he received it in BTC I don't think it changes the tax situation, either it's pre-taxed and already taken care of, or he just pays it later on his tax return, same as if it was USD.

Transactions are currently settling to Ethereum via rollups for less than $0.005, here are some examples from a couple of minutes ago:


Base - https://basescan.org/tx/0x1f205109b6168daa60f297a9c5690ff3d8c22989f7857dd8ce08d31794673b53


Optimism - https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xe3181853e0f7ad2c38b83906c36902584e14b6e0cdfd779b8288709f93b13af1



Which is probably why there are about 150 transactions settling to Ethereum every second: https://rollup.wtf/



Those rollups are in turn paying tens of thousands of dollars to Ethereum L1 each day: https://dune.com/queries/4255122/7155641


In fact Ethereum gets more revenue from its L2s than almost any other L1 collects in total: https://cryptofees.info/


The plan was laid out over 4 years ago now, and is now fully coming to fruition, so it's honestly crazy that some people still don't seem to understand it: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698


And as for being mainstream, Coinbase, Kraken and Sony all have Ethereum rollups; Blackrock, WisdomTree and Visa are all working on tokenizing their traditional financial assets onchain; Venmo and Paypal let users send money to ENS names (whoever.eth)... is anything even remotely as mainstream?

It is fairly simple to calculate the ""fully loaded"" price of BTC from purchase of an ASIC, electricity, warehouse and operational costs and so on. This provides a floor for the price and a certain point it is cheaper to make it yourself than buy it off the market especially with cloud mining. You could claim the rest of the price except the fully loaded price is all manipulation, wash trades, hype and so on.

Comment,lwr0h96,1gplh27,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Polymarket predicts an 88% chance of Scott Bessent becoming Treasury secretary under Trump, signaling a potential shift towards a pro-crypto US policy.
