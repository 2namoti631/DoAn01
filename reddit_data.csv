Post,1gpphzp,,MoonWeek,"Hello everyone and welcome to Moon Week for round 55 of Moons! For more information about Moons, please [see our wiki page here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki). 

We are using Snapshot for voting directly with the Moon balance in your wallet, in a transparent and open manner. For now all Moons held in self-hosted wallets at the time of poll creation will be eligible to vote, so if you are holding Moons on an exchange, the telegram TipBot or in a wallet that you are not comfortable connecting to snapshot then please be sure to transfer your Moons to a self-hosted wallet that you are comfortable connecting to snapshot before each Moon Week. 

To give exposure to our governance polls for the month, this Moon Week post will remain pinned to the top of the subreddit until next Monday. You can [see our schedule here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=i0e5as6q033nruqck5c9nfk24k%40group.calendar.google.com).**Please review the following important information first:**

* Successful polls are implemented whenever the responsible party has a chance to do it. Usually this is within days or weeks of the poll passing, but depends on workload, priorities, and complexity of implementation. You can look at implementation status on [the CCIP list.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LhhqB4UAezNMdAwjV3evFXPD2x1JFCFHdnm8rmyRqAE/edit?usp=sharing)
* In the event of incompatible polls passing, the poll with more Moons voting in favor will be considered the winner and the other will not be implemented.

The goal is to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve of 1 million Bitcoins, held for at least 20 years. The bill faces political challenges but has bipartisan support and could be prioritized by a future Republican-controlled Congress.

>Technically speaking, Okung is still being paid in fiat. Behind the scenes, however, is Lightning Network magic: Strike receives a direct deposit from his team, the Carolina Panthers, and then swaps dollars for bitcoin. That bitcoin is then sent to a cold storage wallet held by Okung, Mallers said. (To recap, Lightning is a secondary system for sending bitcoin in a cheaper and quicker fashion compared to using the Bitcoin network itself.)

Even if he received it in BTC I don't think it changes the tax situation, either it's pre-taxed and already taken care of, or he just pays it later on his tax return, same as if it was USD.

Transactions are currently settling to Ethereum via rollups for less than $0.005, here are some examples from a couple of minutes ago:


Base - https://basescan.org/tx/0x1f205109b6168daa60f297a9c5690ff3d8c22989f7857dd8ce08d31794673b53


Optimism - https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xe3181853e0f7ad2c38b83906c36902584e14b6e0cdfd779b8288709f93b13af1



Which is probably why there are about 150 transactions settling to Ethereum every second: https://rollup.wtf/



Those rollups are in turn paying tens of thousands of dollars to Ethereum L1 each day: https://dune.com/queries/4255122/7155641


In fact Ethereum gets more revenue from its L2s than almost any other L1 collects in total: https://cryptofees.info/


The plan was laid out over 4 years ago now, and is now fully coming to fruition, so it's honestly crazy that some people still don't seem to understand it: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698


And as for being mainstream, Coinbase, Kraken and Sony all have Ethereum rollups; Blackrock, WisdomTree and Visa are all working on tokenizing their traditional financial assets onchain; Venmo and Paypal let users send money to ENS names (whoever.eth)... is anything even remotely as mainstream?

This surge is attributed to rising institutional demand, increased Bitcoin ETF inflows, a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut, and Donald Trump's presidential victory. Despite this achievement, Bitcoin's market cap remains significantly lower than gold's $17.594 trillion. Analysts warn of potential resistance due to elevated funding rates and market euphoria, while key macroeconomic events could influence future price movements.

Trump's strategy includes selecting pro-crypto candidates for key regulatory positions to make the US a global crypto hub.

Schiff, a renowned economist and Bitcoin critic, had previously dismissed Bitcoin's ongoing bull run as a ""popular delusion"" and ""madness of crowds."" However, he now admits that if he had foreseen the cryptocurrency's meteoric rise, he would have invested in it when it was priced at $1.

Hype is what rules it utterly. Doesn't matter if the fundamentals are there, doesn't matter if there are use cases, nothing really matters except hype and greater fools shoveling in money. Even the shitcoin of shitcoins, Doge, has rocketed up recently. In spite of leaking value like mad by the fact it has no maximum ceiling on how many can be printed.

Why do you think Republicans are even turning away from maga? Is it because they magically turn lefties? Or is it because they're leaving the stupid party?



My dude... Honestly think about it deeply by yourself with your own brain.. Why do countries who have nothing to do with America... Absolutely fucking hate people like you and Trump??? 


Is it because the entire fucking planet Earth is lefties??

This milestone was achieved as Bitcoin's price surged to $89,000, marking a 27% increase from the previous week. The rise in Bitcoin's value is attributed to bullish sentiment around Bitcoin ETFs and increased institutional investment. This development highlights Bitcoin's growing acceptance as an alternative to traditional assets like gold, which remains the top global asset with a market cap of $17.667 trillion.

Comment,lworqat,lwo29d4,Quentin__Tarantulino,"Back of the napkin math on law of diminishing returns has it topping out at like $116k.

If more governments follow El Salvador‚Äôs lead, I think $116k is more like a low estimate rather than what it‚Äôll actually hit. 

But if you just extrapolate from the previous highs: 2017 was a 17x from 2013 highs, 2021 was a 3.44x from 2017 (20% growth in 2021 compared to 2017.)

Comment,lwojpg3,lwo12zu,alpeshnaper,"I think this will happen too but not for 15 years or so which is still a good investment by any means. 

I think for this to happen is that it has to become a reserve. Gold did this because it was pegged to a nation's wealth for a very long time but now money is just printed so this would actually be a excellent reason to do so. The next thing is when people start selling gold to buy btc or gold stops growing in worth. This is possible as well because younger generations don't buy gold for the most part. It's either handed down or sitting in some reserve. What does the younger generations belive in, Bitcoin! 

Once the boomers inevitably move on i don't think gold will continue at this pace and become flat in price driving people out and into something else.

Last thing is the whales must move on. These numbers get smaller every cycle so they can't manipulate the price because they still can and do. Reserve funds don't sell off unless the Nation is desperate unlike whales who just sell to buy back lower. When's the last time you heard of a country selling massive amounts of gold? They just print more money. This will happen when the 4 year cycle goes away for the most part and I personally think it may be over already due to the ETF's or maybe it dumps really really hard when all these reserve plans don't happen. 

It's going to take a while but next year will be when we really see how the story plays out.",4,1731376018.0

If you only have a few hundred, or a few thousand to invest, your ROI on Bitcoin is essentially akin to investing in a good stock. If you invest $3000, even if BTC were to hit $200k in the next three years, that would be approximately a 2x on your investment. Great, now you have $6000. 

For most people here, it‚Äôs just not that interesting, compared to cryptos like ETH which have much more room for growth, and are relatively safe and established in the industry.

If you're investing for a decade or more then I'd say 10x (inflation adjusted) or more is still very much in play.  If you mean in the next year then I'd probably agree that more than a 2-3x from here isn't that likely but also far from improbable lol.  I will say though that most people's expected value of return will be highest by just buying bitcoin, and ultimately if you're trying to make money then EV is king.

They are accumulating enormous supply because they are going to turn around and leverage it out the waaaazoooo, and eventually make millions of paper claims to BTC that do not exist. Read about FTX to understand how this works. Also check how gold prices were suppressed. Paper claims to non-existent assets. Woohoo!

Remember, there are regulations on rehypothecation in traditional markets to minimize default risk. No such regulations exist in crypto. The crypto derivatives market is now 8x larger than the spot market, and almost all of it is off chain. This will end badly, and Wall Street types have been warning (bragging?) about this for at least 5 years now.

I don't really see anywhere that shows SUI having an edge, I don't care for the Electric Capital reports but even those show SOL with 3x the devs (based on github commits) but if you look more qualitatively, I'd say it would show even more of a lead for SOL.

Look at how many actual projects are being launch/completed. Maybe more devs are joining SUI, but unless it actually leads to something landing onchain, it means nothing.

That's why I prefer to look at hackathons or just how many popular apps the chains has already. And Solana has a shitload of popular apps and every hackathon has more submissions than the last.

which has been true as long as ALGO has existed, so that's not going to be something that changes, that's something that you think should be a selling point, but the market is telling you it's not.

no one is going to suddenly change their favor on a constantly bleeding asset just because it has marginal yield.

>It also has high and sustained tps showing plenty of real usage.

Comment,lwppcxj,1gp2v40,termn8or3000,"I respectfully disagree with you. 

XRP WILL take off (just how high will be the question but over $1 per coin is reasonable to expect) as I believe that with Gary Ginsler on his way out and a new PRO crypto head likely to be out in by Trump to head the SEC will cause the SEC to drop its current appeal, Ripple will pay its court ordered $125 Million fine (as Ripple has already put aside in a trust to do) and THEN, the SEC will DROP its policy to banks of NOT allowing them to hold any crypto. 

Once this happens and with Ripple ALREADY working with literally HUNDREDS of banks around the world OUTSIDE of the US, banks inside the US will then begin working with/adopting Ripple and utilizing it's XRP. 

This, in turn, will be followed by even MORE banks, inside AND outside the US, adopting Ripple and it's system/XRP tokens which will drive demand thru the roof. Along with all of this will come approval of SPOT ETF's of XRP (and others  besides just Bitcoin) which will drive investments to new all time highs. 

All of this, and more, will serve to drive XRP to possibly break it's ATH and continue to new heights. And it'll all happen relatively quickly, I think. If not BEFORE Jan 20, 2024, then shortly afterwards. 

It's possible that XRP COULD even reclaim its #2 or #3 place within the top 10 crypto's. 

I also believe that Doge, partially because of Elon Musk's involvement in BOTH the coin AND Trump's new admin, will DEFINITELY be one of the top 10 and WILL be VERY hot with $1 per NOT being outside the realm of possibility or reason, either. And I'm NOT a big ""Doge fan"", either and currently only have around 3,000 in my holdings... But that's about to change as I intend to buy several THOUSAND more as I believe Doge will at least DOUBLE from its current price of $0.32 per (though, like I said, I believe it'll go even higher than that)

I see ADA, DOT and SPELL all making Great gains, as well. Among others I bought nearly 3,000 DOT when they were just under $3.00 per and right now they're over $5+ per and this bull run hasn't even REALLY gotten started yet. Just wait until people finally finish taking out some profits (as it's been awhile since they really could) and then watch what happens. 

There'll likely be a short period as crypto consolidates and people catch their collective breath's and the holiday season finally passes and Trump then gets sworn in on 20 Jan 2025.

Somewhere right around all of this, the fuse will get lit and THEN crypto is going to see a bull run to remember. Bitcoin WILL BLAST TO AND THEN PAST $100,000 per (and THAT might even happen BEFORE the end of this month, Nov 2024) and remember you heard it here folks. The sky with Bitcoin is literally the limit right now (and BOY am I GLAD I traded some of my XRP's for some Bitcoins a little while back when I was able to get Bitcoin for a ""mere"" $20,000 per!!) I believe that crypto ( a few in particular, some of which I've already mentioned) are going to explode as if they'd been given an injection (or two) of the most powerful financial steroid ever developed in history

If I HAD to give an opinion on just HOW HIGH I Truly believe XRP alone can/will go this cycle... I'd give it an 85-90% chance of hitting $1 to $5 per. A 50-65% chance of $5 to $10 per. A 25-30% chance of $10-$35 per and a 10% chance of anything higher within this cycle were about to experience. 

And I believe that DOT will run past $10 easily, as well. 

And, in all seriousness, it's even POSSIBLE (Notice though, I'm NOT saying ""likely"") that XRP COULD even hit, or surpass, $100 per and challenge Bitcoin for the #1 spot. It would take for a few, NOT impossible, things to happen for this to take place, but... It COULD happen nonetheless. 

As always, DYOR and understand that all I've said here are my own personal opinions and are NOT meant as any financial advice. And always remember to NEVER invest more than you're willing to possibly LOSE as crypto, as with Stock's and other games of chance, is just another form of gambling. Sometimes you can WIN big, but often you LOSE JUST as big, if not bigger. So make your (informed) choices very carefully and.... Good luck!! üëçüòÅüôè‚ù§Ô∏è",11,1731394366.0

Ripple isn't working with hundreds of banks using xrp. They are using other tech instead of xrp. This is fact. There isn't one bank using xrp.

Again, Xrp isn't being utilized, at all. 

Also, XRP will never be #2 or #3, ever again. The coin depreciates everytime ripple drops another billion xrp into the market.  The amount of money needed for xrp to be propped up to those spots would be astronomical.

I'll even bet you this bull cycle that xrp doesn't even make it to $2 usd. It's been constantly stagnant and the only time it shot up was back in late 2017 for a few days only to crash, because it couldn't sustain those levels.",3,1731425459.0

Comment,lwrtkte,lwq0pbw,SunDreamShineDay,">They sell to keep their doors open

So you think a multi-billion dollar company that in 2024 donated 53 million dollars to a non-partisan PAC for pro crypto legislation is selling XRP to keep the doors open on their 6 offices around the world that 1,200+ employees walk through? That‚Äôs some low effort thought about the reality that is Ripple, sure it‚Äôs easy to say, but it‚Äôs a comment regurgitated. Ripple is an enterprise software and service company with clients worldwide, your comment may apply to many coins and companies but not this one.

Regarding market cap, I don‚Äôt believe using market cap is an accurate tool of prediction to measure future potential of a coin or network, nor it‚Äôs health. 

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Market cap doesn‚Äôt = value - All that happened was more investors were willing to pay a higher price. In the vast majority of cases, no underlying value was added to these assets, did the network get more users? launch a new technology? or achieve more mainstream adoption?

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Market cap only reflects the last transaction price - it assumes all sellers, buyers, and even all holders, including those that aren‚Äôt selling or buying, are at the last transaction price.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Circulating supply is over accounted - The problem is that it‚Äôs hard to tell how much of a coin or token‚Äôs supply is available for trading at any given time, and coins lost or unavailable are NOT excluded when calculating market cap (multiplying the circulating supply X last transaction price)

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Market cap doesn‚Äôt represent real money invested - if the market cap rises or falls by $100 million, it doesn‚Äôt mean $100 million has entered or exited from the asset, in no way helps in understanding the value. Price represents what actually occurs as a result of specific supply and demand conditions, while value is an economic concept that equates all  potential future benefits.

Xiao suggests that clear crypto policies from the US could drive China to accept cryptocurrencies. Additionally, geopolitical factors, such as sanctions on Russia, might expedite China's acceptance of digital assets, potentially shortening the timeline from five or six years to two years. China currently maintains a strict ban on crypto-related activities.

From before the rally, it was clear as day that if BTC broke its ATH it would rally until God-knows-where.

Comment,lwm5ecg,lwm4962,Brushermans,"Yup. I've come to terms with it by just selling portions at prices I'd be happy with, regardless of how high the price continues to go. But I'll always keep a bit even beyond all my price targets, because again, who knows where BTC will top out. This helps me take profits while avoiding FOMO. If my price targets aren't reached? F it, we run it back in 4 years. 

My one rule of thumb after seeing a few cycles is that I would never sell at the old ATH. If BTC does climb back to its previous ATH, it's always rallied *significantly* higher. Selling at the old ATH is just losing the time-value of money during the holding period while not reaping any benefit.",10,1731348163.0

Bitcoin's price increase is part of a broader trend, with other cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, Cardano, and Solana also experiencing substantial gains.

GL getting the biggest exchanges to list a coin doing only $91,895 in daily volume...

At this point I think you have to be more worried about Kraken dropping support rather than any other exchanges adding support.

And that's where others are missing out imo. As long as there's companies willing to buy and burn moons. Moon supply will continue to deflate.  Hypothetically there'll come a day when there's 10 million moons left in circulation. If that day were to come, moons would be a gold mine. But I don't really know if that's realistic to think would happen. Reddit could've shut down entirely before that happens and then there's no reason to buy moons for anybody anymore. Unless the team behind them work out something new for moons. Which we also can't really rely on. What I wanna say is that companies regularly burning moons is promising.

* Phase 2: Bitcon domninance reaching a tipping point (perhaps up to 62%) and then the top cap altcoins start to have their alt-season. (Basiclly the top 20-50 coins)
* Phase 3: General low cap coins surge insanely from scams, gamblers, hopeful hopers, and all who hope to not be too late to any gains etc.
* Phase 4: Crash

Comment,lwr242j,1gplqpf,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced a significant price surge, rising over 70% in the past week, with trading volume reaching $6.18 billion. This increase is attributed to market enthusiasm following recent events in the US, including Donald Trump's election victory and his endorsement of Elon Musk for a proposed crypto department. Analysts predict a 91.16% price increase over the next six months. Increased activity by SHIB 'whales' suggests strong interest from significant investors, indicating potential future gains. Market observers target a price of $0.00081, a 306% increase from current levels.

- Focus on winners not losers

- Rotate minimum. Sit on your hands and don‚Äôt chase every narrative. Can‚Äôt catch them all and accept if something moves without you 

- This is a marathon and not a sprint. So when the time comes, you must preserve capital at all cost to make life changing gains next cycle. Get rich slow

- When you decide to exit the markets completely, don‚Äôt hold tokens because they didn‚Äôt pump yet. They might not pump this cycle

This issuance began with $1 billion on Nov. 6, followed by $2 billion on Nov. 9 and 10, and another $2 billion recently, boosting Tether's market cap to $124 billion. The increase in USDT supply supports liquidity in crypto trading and aligns with a broader market upswing. Tether also launched an open-source wallet development kit to enhance non-custodial wallet integration, empowering developers and businesses.

The idea of timing the market of course is nothing short of ridiculous, and we all know that we want to sell the cringe alts and convert them to BTC when everything goes down, since BTC loses least value and is an absolute beast as we can already see from the charts and the adoption.

So, I'm even having second thoughts right now, I want to unstake everything so I can be ready to sell, December or March 2025 doesn't matter. I don't know about you guys but I won't lose more than 700-800USD from the APY for 4-5 months.

Post,1gporp0,,fan_of_hakiksexydays,"Everything is gonna pump, but not always what you think should pump the most. It's not always gonna follow tech.

It's not always gonna be about what project could solve the trilemma better, what is more decentralized, what has better smart contracts, etc...

# -The most significant factor as we get deeper into a bullrun will be hype and trend, the more the market gets emotional.

We're gonna see some great projects not get much love, and some flawed ones or even meme or shitcoins get more hype.

Bullruns are emotional and work more like Instagram trends than on technical merit. The deeper we get into them, the less they have rhyme or reason. 

# -Don't fight the trend.

Trends are your friend. Once they carry momentum, it's hard for them to stop.

When the market has its mind set on a narrative or a trend, it's hard to undo that.

# -There are times where tech and hype can overlap, if the narrative is right.

In the short run, when you're speculating on just a bullrun, better tech only works if there's some hot hype to go with it. Some bell and whistles, or something that can be marketed easily about that tech that will still catch the interest of the average person who is clueless about tech.

We've seen in past runs how tech like ALGO that was hyped as carbon neutral, Solana for its incredible speed, ADA as based on science, MATIC as something that can make Ethereum faster and cheaper, and many chains like AVAX hyped as ""Ethereum killers"", had simple digestible concepts to hype them.

Which is not to say that the hype didn't come from actual merit, but from something easily sellable to an average person.

Comment,lwk95vi,1gopeuw,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Bitcoin's price surged past $82,000, reaching a new all-time high and sparking 'Extreme Greed' in the crypto market. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index hit 78, indicating heightened optimism and potential risk-taking. This surge coincides with Bitcoin's price jump and Ethereum's gains. The market's enthusiasm is partly due to geopolitical changes, including Donald Trump's re-election, which promises crypto-friendly policies. Historically, 'Extreme Greed' levels often precede market corrections, suggesting potential risks ahead.

Post,1gp8wmv,,stopbanningmeplz24,"Just a friendly heads-up. Not sure how other exchanges work but on Coinbase there can be some pretty lengthy Unstaking times if you intend on selling. It can take up to 30 days to unstake some cryptos before you can sell/ transfer it.

I'm not advising anyone to sell their assets during this period however consider when you need to do this prior to your target sell date/timeline. 

The last thing you want is to stare at your balance shoot down or up and be unable to utilize.

Post,1goyqnm,,GabeSter,"When Crypto is hot and amateurs start flocking to the market, you will see an influx of scammers trying to steal their money. Please be aware of some of the most popular Scams:

# Youtube ads, most commonly about ""doubling your money"".

I have gotten tons of these on my mobile device in the past two weeks. Usually regarding XRP or Solana ""Giving back to the community"" - Send us your funds and we'll send you back double. It's literally a doubling money scam with a new face.

# MEV Bot Scams

This one gets advertised a lot on Youtube as well. Idea is to download a trading bot that will allow you to make money passively by sandwiching users with high Slippage. However you download the bot and then get drained, **seriously if you ever see something about this it's a scam, DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT**. Nobody with a good sandwich bot will give it to you, or they would lose potential income from that bot by allowing other users to trade it.

# Stupidly high APR (commonly advertised on Instagram)

This one is targeted at greedy amateurs and offer stupidly high APR like 2-3% per day for staking ETH. However it's a scam and when you set it up they just drain your wallet.

# Reddit Chat Scams

Seriously if you get chat requests on Reddit about Crypto they're a scammer:

https://preview.redd.it/o5j45uaxab0e1.png?width=366&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aa73ec3327ccbd9ba4daabba72fab5fd78d0daf

# Fake Exchange Email and Phone Call Scams

This one is just pure social engineering. Sending an Email or Phone Call pretending to be an exchange saying something is urgently wrong and trying to get you to provide 2fa information for the scammer to access your exchange account and drain you.

# Classic Pig Butchering

A long term scam where someone messages you in an unsolicited way then works to build report with the idea that you eventually invest in a Scam Crypto Exchange. This one never stopped and you should be aware of it, but the other scams above are on the uptick.",68,1731348460.0

The price increase, driven by retail FOMO, saw ADA reach a three-month high of $0.617. Retail trading volumes surged by 160%, and unique ADA addresses increased significantly. Whale activity also rose, with large transactions hitting a two-month high. Analysts predict ADA could follow a pattern similar to its 2020 bull run, potentially reaching new all-time highs.

This surge indicates renewed investor interest and activity on the network, suggesting a bullish breakout. Ethereum is currently trading at $3,180, with potential to reach its yearly high of $4,000 if it maintains strength above key levels. Analysts are optimistic about Ethereum's long-term bullish trend, especially if it holds above the 200-day moving average, setting the stage for potential new all-time highs.

Despite the internet's drawbacks, it dominates communications due to its affordability and widespread availability, leading to intense competition. Brody suggests that blockchain can achieve similar success by leveraging these competitive advantages.

Comment,lwqlu4x,1gpjirp,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Bitcoin reached a new high of $89,500, yet many portfolios still show losses. The overall crypto market cap is around $2.98 trillion, with a 31% increase in trading volume. Bitcoin inflows are strong, and the Fear & Greed Index is at 'Extreme Greed.' Bitcoin's price is around $88,900, with potential resistance as investors take profits. Despite skepticism, Bitcoin's upward trend continues. Diversification with altcoins is advised, but Bitcoin should remain a portfolio staple. MicroStrategy's Bitcoin investments highlight the benefits of dollar-cost averaging. Solana and Ethereum show growth potential, and BlackRock's significant buy orders indicate rising institutional interest.

Post,1gp4399,,KaladinTheChosen,"I'm a long time holder of cryptocurrency, but to me it's always been an investment vehicle. With the recent launch of BlackRock's ETFs, I am considering pulling the trigger and moving away from self-custody. 

I am confident in my decision, but what I want to understand more is the downfalls of these ETFs in terms of what I want to be investing in. To elaborate, the IBIT and ETHA are both BlackRock's spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum respectively. From what I understand, a spot ETF is required to actually hold the cryptocurrency itself - that is, buying these ETFs is direct exposure to the Coin. 

From viewing comparison tools of BTC-USD vs IBIT and ETH-USD and ETHA these graphs are correlated, but it is not a perfect correlation (70-90%). I want to understand is why it's not a perfect correlation, is it because it's lagging? What else makes these spot ETFs not a perfect correlation that I need to consider in moving away from self-custody? 

In simpler terms, if one person held 1 BTC equivalent within IBIT, and another held 1 BTC as self-custody, who would make more money and why (exclude fees), or would any discrepancies be negligible? ",15,1731361363.0

Comment,lwlyxum,1goxqus,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; MicroStrategy (MSTR), led by Michael Saylor, has shifted its strategy from being a business intelligence software company to focusing on acquiring Bitcoin as its primary treasury asset. The company raises debt and equity to buy Bitcoin, betting on its appreciation. MSTR's net asset value (NAV) is calculated by subtracting its liabilities from its assets, primarily Bitcoin holdings. The strategy relies on Bitcoin's value increasing over time, allowing MSTR to issue more debt and equity to buy more Bitcoin. However, this approach carries risks, as a drop in Bitcoin's value can amplify losses due to the company's leveraged position.

In the mean time, I‚Äôm wanting to invest some spare cash into some crypto with potential to rise fairly steady and be a more short term investment (more like greater than a year, to avoid the short term capital gains, but ‚Äúshort term‚Äù in the grand scheme of things) where I‚Äôd be mostly ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. I‚Äôm not looking for any pump and dumps.

Sorry for the long winded response. If you have any that pop into your mind, or even where to start for research, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it! Respond here or PM me! Thanks!",4,1731307828.0

Comment,lwjuf6e,lwjtdvz,AadamAtomic,">Why do you think polygon has a chance? I‚Äôve held some to awhile but it feels like the project is stagnating.


Polygon runs on Ethereum, acting as a second layer that eases congestion and speeds up transactions.

Whenever people move between Ethereum and Bitcoin, Polygon profits, making it a smart way to leverage the constant trading between these two heavyweights.

Now here‚Äôs what most people overlook: as crypto prices climb, transaction fees do too, and Polygon's layered sharding technology actually thrives on those rising fees.

Polygon‚Äôs value tends to follow the broader crypto market, but with a bit less volatility, basically a safer bet on crypto‚Äôs ups and downs.

I bought a load of Polygon at 9 cents about three years back, and honestly, it's outperformed any bank‚Äôs interest by miles.

While it's the lowest priority on my list, it‚Äôs a stable option with solid potential for growth.",2,1731312261.0

Comment,lwnq2kn,lwnmtiv,VirinaB,"It's too soon after the BTC halving. After the halving, it usually takes about a year, year-and-a-half until the real bull run.

IMO, it's a real bull run when older altcoins like Doge break their ATH from 2017, and do so before the Fear & Greed index gets too high. Right now, F&G is already at about 88% greed (last I checked; yesterday evening) and it hasn't even broken the 40 cent ceiling yet.

Comment,lwkb2vh,1gopj0a,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high of $82,228.41, driven by three main factors. First, Donald Trump's presidential election victory has boosted investor sentiment with promises to make America a 'crypto capital,' including establishing a national Bitcoin reserve. Second, the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts have led investors to seek Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. Lastly, the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs by the SEC has increased institutional participation, further fueling the rally.

Additionally, he will relinquish rights to $70 million in claims on FTX customer deposits. The deal, pending approval by a federal judge, would prevent lawsuits from FTX's debtors. Trabucco resigned from Alameda in August 2022, prior to FTX's collapse, and has since avoided significant legal repercussions.

Comment,lwmri1h,1gord7v,welshpete56,"As others have said, we all thought it was going higher, and before you react its too late, and you wait for a bump, which never comes, then its too too late, and then you've held all the way down. I was up maybe 60% (I started late in the last cycle) and then I was maybe 40% down before I admitted the top had been. 

Start taking profits. If you've DCA'd in this whole cycle, start NOW. Selling some at 85K when you bought at 25K is perfectly fine. Nobody times the top without insane luck. 

Yes, this does not give you the most profit, but will give plenty, and when everyone loses their mind and it drops 40% while you are asleep, it will be much, MUCH less painful.

Comment,lwmxi5w,1gord7v,pigeonwiggle,"there have been trends you can watch for.

but the more popular a trend becomes, the less fulfilling it becomes -- if everyone knows when the music will stop, nobody will pick up the hot potato.  so ""typically crashes in september"" becomes a july/august crash as people seek to avoid the crash.  then september becomes rebound ""buy the dip"" month.  and that's weird.

so here's what IS known:

economy is strong if the S&P is strong -- if NASDAQ sees growth in the tech companies, that's a lot of ""tech money"" gains to place somewhere -- that money often is people taking their winnings to bitcoin.

so market up?  -- bitcoin up.

bitcoin profits?  -- people tend to take those to (specifically) Ethereum.

if the market is still strong, btc and eth are growing, then people will open channel four and start PRINTING MONEY on the shitcoins.  because a healthy btc might double, but a healthy ethereum could triple.  ...and healthy alt coins could go 10x if not 200x.

so where does it crash?

when the economy crashes.  in 2022 the tech boom had overshot it's expectations.  companies were leaking money.  tens of millions on salaries to make the internet more prominent in a world where people just wanted to go outside again.  netflix, google, twitter, disney, all laying off en masse... and the promise of AI and the proliferation of it was meant to reignite hope in a tech-future.

but these things take time.  the bubble had burst.

now?  this run is just a trump celebration as people hope he'll be a de-regulations president and the economy will churn.  ie, it's 2005 and banks are lending mortgages more than ever!  make money while you can!  republicans don't do ""soft landings.""

make your money and get out.

when S&P falters, get out of bitcoin.  when bitcoin falters, sell those alts - get out.  ...buy back into bitcoin once it's crashed.  ...try not to catch a falling knife. ..but have faith that the carousel will spin again soon.",5,1731356731.0

I attribute it to the ‚Äútop signs‚Äù

When your mom starts asking about bitcoin, it‚Äôs time to sell.

Bitcoin pump is going to end precisely when DJT becomes president.

Edit: if you are wondering how those two statements relate, when DJT becomes president, he will promote how him becoming president made bitcoin go up and he is the president of bitcoin. That‚Äôs when you hear about your boomer uncle buying bitcoin. That‚Äôs when you sell bitcoin. This is all a scam to get people to buy bitcoin so whales can dump it off at 110k on uncle Robert. 

Someone please tell uncle Robert that if he hangs onto it for 4 years he will get his money back. God bless uncle Robert.

While I‚Äôm making predictions, Top is 107k - 134k

It‚Äôll slide back down to mid 40s for 3 years, then it‚Äôll do the same thing next election.

Comment,lwn0tc2,1gord7v,fairlyaveragetrader,"Last cycle was really hard, the double peak was insane. It looked like we had a short cycle with the peak in March. Things were starting to get weird around 40K which is where I dumped but I was watching the market the whole time, it runs up into the '60s in March then the crash comes and I'm like well I dodged that one. Then the second peak happens and the altcoin mania. 

The only take away I really have is if you make good money, be happy you made good money and don't overthink it, you're never going to get this perfect. The first peak was insanely difficult and the second one was a little more traditional but it also kind of acted like a short cycle. Everyone was fixated on 100k which is more or less a beginning point this time. I don't know what number they're going to fix it on this time, knowing social media it's probably going to be something ridiculous like 420K but they haven't even started the top calling euphoric price targets yet

The near term price Target is probably 120 to 140 k. We will see what people do with that, would be unusual for it to be the actual high though because that's only a 2x basically from the 2021 high. There's also really really good narrative this time around and does anyone know when the ibit options are going to get approved?

Comment,lwnycrk,1gord7v,jacd03,"In my opinion from the past 2 bullruns, (where i sold early on one and late on the other one) its always going to be the price in the middle from 2 points, the market has to fuck both sides:

1) The ATH the doubters think we are going to reach, right now its $90K (this guys provide liquidity for the blow out top) and 2) The ATH most of the media keeps talking about, wich is around $150 to $200K for the most part (people that belive in this, will be exit liquidity on the distribuiton phase). This way you inflict pain on both sides, the people that will FOMO after $90K-$100K reached and we keep on going, but also the ultra bullish people waiting on $100K. what happened on 2021? I remember there were a lot of doubters around $45K to $55K then we broke out and you started hearing $100K and beyond, then we stopped going up and you know the rest...

In previous cycles the consensus rotation has been BTC -> ETH -> Large Cap Alts -> Small Cap Alts.This rotation cycle hasn't really had a material impact on or correlation with stock prices.

This time i feel might be different. There's much bigger volumes and institutional players involved. I think there might be a bigger rotation this time back into stocks and less into small caps alts, particularly the Magic 7. This could be enough to have a non-neglible impact on stock prices.

 Like many others greed got the best of me and I will not make the same mistakes again.

The eth to btc hasn't been this low since pre 2021 rally which tells its own story.

Comment,lwfr7nu,1go11lv,-Blue_Bull-,"I think it's overvalued personally. I have a stop market sell set at $70k. That's what I feel it's actually worth. Of course, if we make it to $100k, I'll move this up to $80k.

People should give the market some wiggle room, I learnt years ago that a wide stop is how you protect your gains once the bear market comes, and it will come.

The losers will be the same greedy late comers who buy the highs.

We've had Trump fever, now it's boomer fever, what comes next is either a liquidation run or the populism trade.

What the world is banking on now is the switch from liberal democracy to authoritarianism. People want it, but can Trump really deliver it, or is it all talk and optics. This will determine the future price of risk on assets such as BTC.

Trump alone can't do this, the UK and Europe needs to follow suit. The UK definitely has the appetite for it, but it needs Europe to continue it's Overton window shift, not to mention fend off Russia and win the war in Ukraine.",1,1731258643.0

Bitcoin attracted $1.8 billion in inflows, bolstered by post-election optimism and macroeconomic factors. The surge in inflows reflects increased investor confidence in digital assets, with Bitcoin ETFs seeing record inflows, highlighting mainstream adoption. The Trump victory has amplified demand for Bitcoin and other high-risk assets, with expectations of a more accommodating stance towards financial innovation.

I‚Äôve been through multiple bull runs, and every time the greed + excitement has gotten me to hodl just a ‚Äúlittle bit longer‚Äù when the numbers hit what I was looking for, so I didn‚Äôt sell, then things crashed, resulting in LESS profit overall. This is embarrassing - I‚Äôm not ‚Äòbragging‚Äô about making the same mistake multiple times - but hopefully someone can learn and profit off my bumbles. 

Good luck all. 

EDIT: Some of y‚Äôall really need reading comprehension skills. I am not saying sell NOW, I‚Äôm saying set up a goal for WHEN to sell (whether it is amount or date)and think about WHY you would sell.

I haven‚Äôt posted here in a long time and you‚Äôve reminded me why. And for those who will never sell - if you just want to ‚Äúcollect‚Äù stuff, comics and coins are cheaper. For those who want to enjoy life and DO something with yr gainz, start getting used to the fact that you‚Äôll eventually have to sell. if you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôve got jack shit but an intangible binary claim.

ETH has hung on because it's a good platform for building alts.  Same thing with SOL.

I wish I could give you a number but I can‚Äôt. One thing I have learned is to not sell EVERYTHING I‚Äôve got of a coin/token so that if it ever moons again, I can sell a bit for the satisfaction. 

So after something doubles, I‚Äôll sell 30 to 50% - that way I‚Äôve got all or most of my investment back. Then I‚Äôll set up sells every 10% or so, little here, little there. Everything has different amount of potential, esp depending on time you get in. Some coins I expect 4x gains, others I‚Äôll be thrilled to get 1.5x back.",5,1731290747.0

*The .moon domain Telegram giveaway is dependent on a partnership with Unstoppable Domains that was voted on coming to fruition if for whatever reason it does not, this giveaway will be voided.* 

Multiple additional Giveaways for Redditors and X users to get a free .moon domain will be coming in the near future assuming the voted on partnership comes to fruition. ",4,1731357051.0

The bitcoin price has increased by 20% in a week, with other cryptocurrencies like ethereum, dogecoin, and cardano also seeing significant gains. The Federal Reserve and China's actions are contributing to a 'perfect storm' for bitcoin's price rise.

Dont worry about catching the bottom for these coins and doing many small orders,  it doesn't matter if you enter at 0.59 or 0.55 for smth like XRP if it's going 30%up or more in the next few days/weeks. Just make sure you have enough to hold the position so you dont get wiped on market corrections. So like 100$ in the wallet if you're putting 5$ etc. With that kind of leverage you'll be swimming in money even with a small investment.

Comment,lwf89g7,1go321b,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Ethereum's market capitalization reached $383 billion as its price hit $3,200, surpassing Bank of America's market cap of $346 billion. This milestone highlights the growing influence of blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) over traditional finance. The rise in Ethereum's value comes amid discussions by the US SEC about listing options tied to spot ETH ETFs. Despite a recent inflationary trend in ETH supply, market sentiment remains optimistic, with analysts predicting further price increases and potential new all-time highs.

Post,1gohgh7,,galacticwyandotte,"Last post about it here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1egcdnl/friend\_got\_that\_mt\_gox\_payment/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1egcdnl/friend_got_that_mt_gox_payment/)

Update: Friend confirmed he got the payments. First was in cash (a small amount) then the second payment was the transfer of BTC. I'm pretty sure, based on you guys' previous posts here, that my Friend received more than he initially told me. He lost 60+ btc at the time of Mt Gox crash. He might have gotten 10 btc from the settlement I read. That was a few months ago. 

I advised him not to sell when this was on the way.  He listened apparently. He sold a very small amount he said. To throw a party. It wasn't outrageous and he didn't advertise it was from his btc settlement. He kept it lowkey and just threw himself a bday celebration with a lot of his friends and their families. Modest food and drinks provided.  

I'm guessing he sold 1 or 2 btc, but maybe less. I'm guessing he's sitting on 8+ bitcoin right now. With the rate things are going post-election, that'll be worth $1M+ in a couple months potentially. He only works part-time now, he doesn't need the salary, but he does need the social interaction and community that it provides. He is independently wealthy, single, early 40s, and lives alone. Seems pretty happy but hasn't let it go to his head or changed his lifestyle in a big way. He loves playing sports. 

This guy is the only one I know IRL who had this happen to him, and who owns this much btc, and who does not need to work full-time and be in the rat race of life. It's an incredible story. The dude won. He's still winning. Obviously he needs to sell at the right time to officially have that money in the bank.  I'm glad that I know someone who beat the casino, even though he originally had 6x more, but he def woulda sold much earlier instead of this forced hodl strategy.

We have some very unique circumstances with the new BTC ETFs that make crypto more accessible and safer to otherwise ignorant new crypto potential investors. 

In the 2016 pre bull to 2017 bull year BTC 19X‚Äôd

In 2020 pre bull to 2021 Bull year BTC 2.37 X‚Äôd

Both Pre year Bull highs happened in December. Both were 30% and 75% higher than their November 2016 and 2020 monthly highs.

It will be very interesting to see what Novembers actual high will be in 2024. I‚Äôm conservatively thinking approximately 85,000 in November and approximately 20% increase in December to a 102,000. Based on that estimate and a 2 to 2.5X would be about 204,000 to 255,000.. just a guesstimate as we could also see some additional catalysts with the general favorable acceptance from the new presidency.

Lots of money is in meme coins currently. The total crypto market cap is about where we were at the last peak but it's in BTC, SOL, ETH and memes for the vast majority. Once the meme hype slows down we'll see top alts rise again to near ATH's, some lower if their supply was massively inflated since last bull.

Also the top will be in around June or so because of so many people front running it. Also the economy is fucked so people are gambling hard as fuck now because they're poor. They're getting desperate. Debt is at record levels and so are credit defaults.

Post,1gp8ij9,,No_Surprise_6294,"I know that lots of people have a good experience with the wallet, but let me tell you how they handle problems if they do, in fact, arise. I have an Android phone, and I put the app in the secure folder (as you should, more locks wouldn't hurt), created a backup on the Google drive, which allows access to recovery phrase, etc and forgot about the wallet for a while.

Yesterday, I opened the app to make sure that I still got access to it, and I did. Everything looked fine, so I copied the address and send a bit of crypto first. Received, very well. Sent more. Finally, when I wanted to swap crypto to some tokens, it prompted a fingerprint, so I pressed it and the error popped up ""Face recognition is not available"" (even though it was a fingerprint prompt). I tried again, nothing. Well, it turns out that the app doesn't work in the secure folder. It has never been mentioned neither on the website nor on the app page in Google store. I couldn't access the seed phrase either, because it also prompts the fingerprint that doesn't work. I should have not relied on the app and tried it in the first place but you never assume something like that can happen with a renown wallet. The funny part is that the backup doesn't work properly, and it didn't save it at all 

So, I never lost access to my account, it was not stolen but the app was just straight up broken. Surely, not their fault since I should have written the seed phrase, but they should make the app work properly in the first place as well. Anyways, moving along, just letting you know that these guys won't take responsibility for anything and technically I was wrong for trusting the app. Beware, if you have a choice, choose something else.

TDLR Rainbow wallet turns out to be not working at all if you put in the Secure folder. I was blamed for not being more cautious.",0,1731373067.0

Post,1go2tg8,,OwlSuspicious9254,"Mid-thirties male here.  I was out with some friends last night.  A friend and I who have both been into crypto the last few years were talking about a few different altcoins.  A few of our friends overhearing laughed and were surprised we were still into crypto.  You could tell they had no clue what we were talking about and that Bitcoin is currently at an all time high.

We‚Äôve jumped from $60k to $80k BTC quickly over the last few days but it is clear that the average retail person is not here yet.  I think it will take Bitcoin close to or above $100k for a week before retail investors start to pay attention.  So far this bull run I believe it‚Äôs mostly just been people here from last cycle and paying attention over the last couple of years.  WE‚ÄôRE STILL EARLY PEOPLE!

I won‚Äôt start to take gains until I get those texts from random people asking me what obscure altcoins they should be buying.  Enjoy the bull run people.  Those of us that endured the bear market deserve it!

He is completely wrong and searching his post history is hysterical, he is a no-coiner and is too emotionally invested in crypto (in this case it failing) to look at this objectively. You may not make life changing money on Bitcoin buying at 80k, but you are beyond delusional if you think you aren't still ""early"" to completely change your life on an emergent token. This entire asset class has just been completely legitimized by the sitting president of the united states. For fuck sake he's creating a fucking DeFi platform. What do you think will happen next?

Considering half of these redditors thought the bullrun started earlier this year and not in the last week, the rule applies - always do the opposite of what r/cryptocurrency's consensus is. Morons were fading Solana last year and it's almost singlehandidly propelled my 2023 portfolio within spitting distance of 7 figs ($400k gain). I absolutely have made life changing money already and the bull run just began. You now have institutions investing heavily into the space and builders creating protocols that will print new millionaires next year.

Every time someone has wanted to bring memes back, I've asked why not just subscribe to r/CryptoCurrencyMemes if that's the content you want? They never respond.

Something we could do now that reddit is out of the mix is add r/CryptoCurrencyMemes to the distribution and weight all karma there much lower. I think that would be the best situation for both subreddits, moons, mods, and the users.


Not terribly important to the point, but I would dispute that r/CryptoCurrencyMemes has not caught on. Other than our new sub r/CryptoHelp, it's been the best growing subreddit in our network https://i.imgur.com/Upqz2Hm.png Just like any crypto sub, it slowed during the bear or crab months, but it's picked up when the market has.

95% of the moderation of r/CCMemes has been deleting memes that are meant to advertise and usually don't even have any humor. That would be a very negative stream of content to add to r/CC. It's also much harder to apply filters in a general sub like r/CC than to a meme sub.",7,1731379168.0

Comment,lwnkzft,1gore9g,Dismal_Advantage_388,"Isn't the whole point of DCAing that there isn't a bad time? If you DCA, you do it because you're in it for the long game. In theory, BTC will continuously grow in value on long-term scales. So even if you start putting in $100/month or whatever your investment budget is, and BTC crashes down to 30k in march... You don't care, because the next all time high will be far higher than whatever high we're climbing to now. And you'll be continuing to buy for dirt cheap during the deepest trough.

Short answer: no. If DCA is your strategy (and it's the only wise strategy) then ""immediately"" is the best time to start regardless of what the market is doing. 

You only lose money if you freak out and sell when the inevitable crash comes. Hold on and keep buying during the tough times and you will be rewarded.",1,1731363962.0

Comment,lwkigjv,lwj9zsu,Bruggok,"https://www.microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-announces-pricing-of-offering-of-convertible-senior-notes_09-18-2024

Microstrategy is offering unsecured $875 million worth of $ 0.625% bond. $524 million of the proceeds will redeem its earlier $500 million 6.125% bond that was secured by collateral.

0.625% of $875 million is $2.73 million interest paid twice a year. Easy for the company‚Äôs non-bitcoin operation to handle. However, because bitcoin is a non revenue generating asset, the company cannot keep issuing bonds and stocks to buy bitcoins. The rest of the company cannot handle more and more cash flow out on its smaller core business.

Additionally, when that bond is due in 2028, the company needs $875 million to repay those bond holders, so it has to issue more bonds, equity, or sell bitcoins. That‚Äôs why I said when bitcoin price drops significantly, MicroStrategy has to sell bitcoins (before further price drop) to ensure it can repay outstanding bonds. Th company has to sell bitcoin eventually because the price of bitcoin does not just go up.",1,1731327556.0

This rise is part of a broader crypto rally following Donald Trump's election victory and a Federal Reserve rate cut. SOL's price has increased by 34% over the week, outperforming Bitcoin and the CoinDesk 20 Index. The token's all-time high was $260, and analysts suggest it could reach this level again soon.

Comment,lwiwhuy,lwhoecy,jawni,"just in case you're serious:

>>For the record, VanEck believes SOL is a commodity, much like BTC and ETH. This belief is informed by evolving legal perspectives, where courts and regulators have begun to recognize that certain crypto assets may function as securities in primary markets but behave more like commodities in secondary markets. Also, over the past year Solana has made substantial progress in decentralization; the top 100 holders now control approximately 27% of the supply, a significant reduction from a year ago. Moreover, the top 10 addresses now hold less than 9%. With over 1,500 validators across 41 countries, operating in more than 300 distinct data centers, Solana boasts a Nakamoto Coefficient of 18‚Äîsurpassing most networks we monitor. The upcoming Firedancer client will further bolster decentralization, ensuring no single entity can dominate the blockchain. This decentralized infrastructure, combined with SOL's utility and economic role, aligns it closely with digital commodities like BTC and ETH. We remain committed to advocating this position alongside our exchange partners to the appropriate regulators

Post,1gp6lwf,,Telkk2,"Got a question that's been concerning me. Coinbase and other exchanges clog up during bullruns and banks are notorious for freezing transfers to review. I'm scared if I wire to my bank, coinbase or my bank or both will hold it for a long time and it'll be a huge headache. Then there‚Äôs the fact that I'll wanna buy back in years later on the next big bull cycle. That'll be another huge headache.

I know I can and should be transferring small amounts at a time but, again, huge headache and no guarantee it'll go through smoothly. My question to everyone is, should I swap it into a stable coin and just hold it in a cold wallet till the next bull cycle or do the wire transfers to and from my bank?

Structuring is illegal, while the money being moved might have been legally obtained, structuring is still illegal, even if the funds were legitimately earned.

So the best you can do if you wanna sell and it‚Äôs more than 10K, you talk to the exchange‚Äôs and bank‚Äôs customer support line and let them know your intentions and ask if there will be any problems before hand.

Comment,lwphsvh,1gp6lwf,S7EFEN,"if we're talking about risk i think stable coins are a big weak point in terms of possible black swan events. like. imagine USDT just decides 'nah, we wont be redeeming USDT for cash and they like literally take the money and run. Or, it turns out USDT is investing in more than just bond equivalents. Or, they are investing in bond equivalents but we have another 2020-2024 situation with bonds and bonds end up massively underwater. The fed probably won't bail out tether like they would a bank. Sure, they promise that theyll redeem your USDT for a dollar... but what if they don't? Your damages are capped at... whatever can be recovered in a bankruptcy proceeding.

With the excitement of the election, all the fomo were seeing right now, plus the etfs, it's very much possible we see 100k soon, maybe even before the years over.


And don't forget about the fact that halving affects prices in more than a year, which still isn't due. 2025 could be great for the entire market. Three trillion market cap will only drive further fomo. We still have two months left for the year, and so far the markets done great after post-election.


Whatever the case may be, remember that nothing, especially I  the cryptonnarket where you'll experience high volatility, is certain. The same thing happened during the 2021 bull run as well, with everyone hoping for 100k, with the result being 15k in only a few months. ",140,1731251511.0

Comment,lwcqc6q,1gnqtde,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Standard Chartered forecasts a fourfold increase in the digital assets market cap, reaching $10 trillion by late 2026, driven by anticipated regulatory shifts following a projected Republican sweep. The bank predicts Bitcoin will reach $200,000 and Ethereum $10,000 by the end of 2025. Factors contributing to this growth include potential regulatory changes, favorable stablecoin regulations, and a softer SEC stance on digital assets. The report highlights strong growth potential for sectors like gaming and tokenization.

Most inflows came from the US, while Europe saw minor inflows. Ether ETFs also saw significant inflows, marking a positive shift in sentiment.

Post,1gpbl6o,,HurrayYouReadMyName,"The current market cap for r/cryptocurrency moons stands at about 14 million. 

To me this is just absolutely laughable when compared to meme tokens outside of the top 500 with 0 use case. Moons are an interactive currency in the largest discussion group for cryptocurrency. If you scroll down to the top 500 coins by market cap you‚Äôll notice most of these coins have zero use case with nobody having heard of them at all. Despite this, these coins have a market cap of 70 million! If moons had a market cap of this, it would 5x and blow past its ATH.

Moons price if it‚Äôs market cap caught up with the rest of the market:

Top 700: $0.29 with a 36m Market Cap = 2.2x

Top 600: $0.45 with a 50m Market cap = 3.5x

Top 500: $0.67 with a 74m Market cap = 5.1x

Top 400:  $0.95 with a 105m Market cap = 7.5x

Top 300: $1.79 with a 170m Market cap = 13x


Most of the these coins in the top 700 are just meme tokens, so to me it seems very possible for moons to enter the top 700 due to it being the community token on the biggest forum for crypto.",0,1731382351.0

We also have governance, tipping, distributions, a partnership with Unstoppable Domains coming up and much more. 

We already hit 70 cents in a bearish March and since then our advertisers bought and burned around 500,000 Moons which is gonna help a lot with the selling pressure on our way past $1.

if you‚Äôre wondering why America voted for Trump, allow me to explain:

The truth is, the American People are sick of your shit.

You ruined our nation and our culture. You openly mocked, belittled, and discriminated us, then called us racist, misogynist, Nazis when we started noticing.

You defiled and corrupted all of our great institutions, to include the media, social media, tech, academia, intelligence, health, pharma, Hollywood, entertainment, sports, EVERYTHING! You weaponized every aspect of American life, and used it to push your insane far-Left agenda down our throats.

You told us Trump was a Russian asset that was going to start WW3 and would be worse than Hitler. Then you used that as an excuse to justify hatred towards Trump supporters and to riot in the streets. You used it as an excuse to obstruct and ruin Trump‚Äôs entire first term, and it turned out it was all a lie.

Then during Covid, you demanded we all be forced to take medical experimentation without testing. You wanted dissenters locked in prison. You wanted children taken from their anti-vax parents. You wanted the anti-vax in camps. You were rooting for our deaths. Then it turned out you were wrong about everything from the man-made origin, to masks, to vaccines, to social distancing, to ivermectin, to HCQ, to natural immunity, and everything in between.

Then during Ukraine, you told us that Ukraine was a bastion of Democracy, and that they desperately needed all of our tax dollars. Then it turned out that Ukraine is one of the most corrupt nations in the world, with literal Nazi military forces, and it was actually just a money laundering operation to steal from the American taxpayer. You want to defend Ukraine‚Äôs borders more than our own. You sent hundreds of billions of dollars on the other side of the planet, while Americans are suffering, all based on more lies.

Then there‚Äôs the whole Epstein, Diddy, human-trafficking element. You all told us VEHEMENTLY that human-trafficking was a myth, you told us the border was secure, and you told us that anyone who questioned it was an irredeemable & deplorable conspiracy theorist (and a piece of garbage). You said anyone who watched ‚ÄúSound of Freedom‚Äù was a QAnon extremist and threat to democracy. Then it turned out to be true, and the elites really are engaged in unspeakable crimes against children. After you all told us for decades this was not true. You covered up the most heinous crimes imaginable, for political gain.

I could do this for days, but I think you get the point. The American People are awake to the scam and the true evil going on around us, and we are not going to stand for it anymore. So we hired Donald J. Trump and his team of Patriots to rectify the situation, and bring America back to her greatness.

This is the reality of the situation. You are the bad guys, and you have been deceived. The sooner you wake up to it, the sooner you can join us in repairing this nation. Or you can choose to deny reality, and spend the rest of your lives consumed by hate, based on lies.

The choice is yours.

Comment,lwfav6t,1gnsv3t,MarvinTAndroid,"Here are a few of the times Mr Schiff was part of the BTC is dead chorus: 


1. August 20, 2011
""Bitcoin is a fad, just like the tulip craze. It‚Äôs fool‚Äôs gold.""
Schiff dismissed Bitcoin in its early days, comparing it to past speculative bubbles.


2. December 4, 2017
""Bitcoin is a bubble... just like the dot-com bubble, only worse. People are buying it because they think they can sell it for a higher price.""
During Bitcoin's 2017 bull run, which saw it reach nearly $20,000, Schiff predicted it would crash, asserting that BTC had no intrinsic value.


3. June 26, 2019
""It‚Äôs digital fool‚Äôs gold. If you want a safe haven, gold is the answer, not Bitcoin.""
Schiff maintained his stance even as Bitcoin surged again, saying BTC was no match for gold as a hedge against economic uncertainty.


4. March 2020 (after the COVID-19 market crash)
""Bitcoin crashed right along with everything else. It‚Äôs not the safe haven asset that its promoters claim.""
Schiff criticized BTC‚Äôs performance during the global market collapse, suggesting it failed as a hedge against financial crisis.


5. November 2020
""Bitcoin is an asset that has nothing real behind it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a speculative bubble.""
As BTC rallied toward $20,000 again, Schiff remained pessimistic, saying Bitcoin lacked the foundation of tangible value.


6. March 3, 2021
""Bitcoin is the modern-day version of fool‚Äôs gold... If people were buying Bitcoin thinking it's going to be like gold, they‚Äôre going to be sorely mistaken.""
As Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high near $60,000, Schiff continued to denounce it as an unstable, speculative asset.


7. November 2021
""Bitcoin has no future as money or as an asset. Eventually, it‚Äôs going to collapse under its own weight.""
Amidst BTC‚Äôs historic rally to almost $69,000, Schiff was adamant that it would ultimately fail.


8. April 2022
""The only use case for Bitcoin is speculation. When the bubble bursts, it‚Äôll have no value at all.""
Even as BTC became more widely adopted, Schiff argued that its only real value was as a speculative vehicle, predicting an eventual crash.


9. November 2022 (following the FTX collapse)
""Bitcoin‚Äôs days are numbered. People are starting to see the writing on the wall.""
After the FTX scandal shook the crypto industry, Schiff argued that BTC would be doomed by association.",2,1731253488.0

Comment,lwd7fsn,1gnsv3t,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Economist Peter Schiff has warned the crypto community that President-elect Donald Trump may not fulfill his campaign promises regarding Bitcoin. Trump had pledged to make Bitcoin part of a U.S. strategic reserve, halt government Bitcoin sales, and oppose a central bank digital currency. Schiff, a known Bitcoin critic, predicts Trump will break these promises, suggesting gold as a safer investment. Despite Bitcoin's recent price surge linked to Trump's election, Schiff cautions against over-optimism, hinting at a potential price drop if Trump fails to deliver.

Comment,lwdn572,1gnv02x,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $79,000 for the first time in history during a weekend pump, resulting in the liquidation of $280 million in bearish crypto trades. BTC rose 4%, extending its 7-day gains to over 16%. The rise followed a week marked by Donald Trump's election as U.S. president and a 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve, both seen as bullish by traders. Weekend pumps are typically bullish in the crypto market due to lower trading volumes and liquidity, leading to more volatile price movements.

I was incensed by the bailouts, TARP, fiat as an emporor wearing no clothes but backed by nuclear and military capability and faith 

Nothing lasts forever.  A generation off the gold standard millions become billions become trillions then hyper into quadrillions.  Just numbers, all made up by hype machines of Rothschilds grace.

Bitcoin, encoded with the headline re: bailouts in UK, sucked me in from the Gold Is Money forum and I never looked back. 

The next big issue will be privacy and control.  Adam Back and others decisions in 2015(or 16?) leading to BCH fork relegated Bitcoin as a store of value and a less efficient payment system.  

Monero is everything I hoped Bitcoin would evolve into, and it's the only crypto I've had true diamond hands with.  From .03 BTC to .002 BTC conversion, it's the dystopian 1984 social credit score eyeball scanning world's only legitimately private payment.  Truly anonymous global cash, if you will.

I think we hit $250-350k this cycle (in Q4 2025), but with black swans and other potentialities who knows.. all I know is that just as gold has maintained purchasing power for centuries, Bitcoin has replaced it as the modern store of value in a digital era.

But it's crypto. It might really do that and run until Q4. It might have a big correction in 2025 due to recession, but then shoot up again like crazy (like 2021 after summer dump).


Ugh. Always opportunities with crypto but also a lot of risk.

Personally, I have some targets for my alts where I will start to.dca out. I'm still in red -10-20% on some of them, even after that crazy week. And I think there will be some corrections soon. So it will take time until I can start DCA out. The bear on alts was that bad l",-1,1731235368.0

Comment,lwf2i1c,lwe7prg,Twitxx,Can you please explain what exactly is adhd burnout?,2,1731250693.0
Comment,lwg1qkq,lwf2i1c,fatty_boombatty,"I jut read what i wrote, long, sorry, adhd over explaing/ verbal diarrhoea ... 

After my diagnosis a couple of years ago I realised I've had a few smaller ones over the years. The Big one was pretty devastating.



In brief, as a way of functioning in the world, over years I'd created a set of rules that I needed to live by as a way of masking my impulsive behaviour and to deflect from my inattentiveness and procrastination (I have combined adhd). I was not explicitly conscious that I'd done this, i was just trying to stay in work and raise my family. I managed to get senior roles in chaotic complex multi year business change programmes with very large companies. I was never qualified, I walked into it, said yes whenever I was asked, and was  good at crisis and ambiguity. I was a well paid freelancer contract worker.



This took a disproportionate amount of energy to appear capable and I was riddled with anxiety.



About 12 years ago, my rules gradually stopped working and my world shrank. 6 years ago I had no idea who or what I was. Without my rules/ structure I didn't exist.



I started a 2 year process to get my affairs in order after which I would end my life. I knew how and roughly when. My kids & wife would be provided for. Covid hit, i was getting away with working at 20% of my capacity and was broken. My business failed & it was time to go. I felt no emotion at all about it, I believed I would be doing my family no harm.



Anyway, in like a flash of awareness on the day I would die, I became aware of a question: I wonder what life would be like if I carried on and had no answers to anything. At that point I had a complete breakdown and life unravelled. I found some work, started yoga, lived the existential death, started therapy.



I was burned out several times before that and it had got worse each time because I didn't know wha it was or how to take care of myself.



Folk with undiagnosed or unmanaged adhd can use so much energy trying to pretend to be ""normal"", they risk burnout. They are at greater risk of suicide, injury, imprisonment, and addiction.



This is also true for lots of folk that do not have adhd. 



Burnout is also frequently experienced by folk working in organisations where long hours under extreme pressure are expected, there is often a critical culture of failure for anyone that buckles.



I massively over delivered where it was not expected and always felt like a failure that was on the verge of being fired and homeless (even though my savings were OK and my reputation strong).



I have now quit corporate work, I'm broke but retraining as a psychotherapist specilising in ADHD & neurodivergence. I'm at peace, I am very involved with my family and great friends with my ex wife.



If anyone recognises any part of this, please talk to someone. Seek help whether you have adhd or not. There is so much beauty in a life where we don't know, so much aliveness in the process of becoming aware of yourself and others, even when it is deeply uncomfortable and painful.",13,1731261845.0
Comment,lwh1mx9,lwg1qkq,Twitxx,"Let me start by thanking you for taking the time to write all of this. I deeply resonate with it and it's why I asked in the first place. I've personally been through several burnouts and one suicide attempt by the time I was 27. In the past, I've been diagnosed with treatment resistent depression, generalised anxiety, OCPD and only recently I've started receiving ADHD medication, after getting my diagnosis.

I get you, I have spent most of my life trying to pretend and struggling to keep up, even though I was overachieving, it would always last so long before depression or burn out would kick in, especially because of the perfectionism. No treatment ever worked until now, butI have found some peace and relief in traditional remedies such as adaptogenic mushrooms and yoga. The ADHD medication helps to provide order and peace in my thought process, and I feel like I can finally live in the present and not in my mind. I have only just started this two weeks ago, so it is a bit early but I am hopeful that I am on the right part. It can be so hard to get the help you need while under duress but I'm glad I got here.

Reading what you wrote was hard, at first, but it did make me feel like I'm not alone in this so thank you. I am so glad that it worked out for you in the end, and that you manage to find your place and be happy, that you could heal. What you said brings hope and I want you to know that I appreciate you taking the time to write this. I wish you luck, kind stranger.",4,1731272494.0

My sense is that meds will let me function while I rebuild resources, I'm done with pretending so less likely to burn again (although mindfulness is so important).

Ashwagandha and magnesium nitrate help greatly in reducing stress, taking some vitamin D during winters eases depression.

Comment,lwdqnar,1gnuhu4,Necromancer1899,"In the past few years I've followed a fairly conservative strategy when it comes to crypto. I try my best to protect my principal, and then play around a bit with the gains. It has probably prevented me from making massive gains, but I've enjoyed excellent returns over the past 5 years.

For example, let's say I've managed to accumulate $10 worth of Ada at an average of 30 cents. Once it hits the 60 cents mark, I will take out the principal, i.e $10 and then slowly keep taking profits in instalments till the end of the run. 

This is of course contingent on consistently investing during the bear market, and getting in at good price points. Also, you may miss out on massive returns. But I believe that it's better not to lose sleep over profits that you could've potentially made than to lose money on an investment. The market will always provide opportunities, we need to have a long term vision and always try to keep enough cash in hand so that potential opportunities can be explored.",10,1731224805.0
Comment,lwdps67,1gnuhu4,fairlyaveragetrader,"If you were  in in 2020 you had a massive profit in 2021. I swear this happens every time with people who start in a really good place during a cycle and then they ride it up and ride it down. 

It's beginning to go up again, why would you sell now? All you're going to do is buy it back in at a higher price in a few months, feel really good about it and then ride it back down again. Like that's seriously what people do

It does however help a lot to have a goal in mind. Think about what that is, develop one and DCA out on your way to achieving it. Most the time there are at least three waves up so the first one above the old all-time high is probably going to be a 100k. People are probably going to be selling 95. After that it kind of depends on momentum but 140 would be a target, after that it's definitely no man's land. It could go on a parabolic blow off and double again, it could go a little bit higher and then do a 2021 fake out dip.

Let's hope future people do the same for everyone else.

But to get 100x you're going to need a lot more people paying into the system.  The current community will stop working so they won't be buying.  We'll get some new buyers but they aren't going to buy more than 100s worth a month each - you can only buy with the left over money in your account after paying rent etc.  So for us to all sell for 1000s we need a lot of new buyers.

There is literally nothing you as a person could do in crypto before Gensler joined the SEC that you can't do now. 

Exchanges are being forced to register.

Exchanges are forced not to mingle user-funds with their own funds.

Exchanges are forced to report regularly to show financial health.

Exchanges are forced to comply with checks on whether the customer funds are handled properly.

But the same people that cry that SBF gave Alameda access to FTX-Userdata so they could rip off the customers are also fighting against the SEC chair that wants Exchanges to register and to be monitored, so things like that can't happen... 

Anti-Gensler isn't about crypto... it is about reporting requirements for short selling and the implementation of the CAT system on wall street. That's what caused Citadel to donate millions to congress goons, who then started to attack Gensler on Crypto.

They told you the problem was that SBF talked to FTX, because they did not want you to think that the real problem was that Coinbase did not.

Coinbase failed to file a form that I could find within 3 minutes using google, claiming that the form was not made available to them and how the SEC refused to educate them exactly over how their business is required to report, when figuring this out was their own job.

I guess it's safe to say we are in the bull market right now. Yet most altcoins holders are still far way from break even.

In my case I bought Polkadot in 2021 near ATH and dca until average price was 24$.

From what we learn all these years we slhoud DCA in during bears and dca out during bears.

But I still feel it's way to early to dca out. But the truth is nobody can predict the future. Nobody knows. What we know it's that there's no shame in selling in profit, and **everyone who HODL BITCOIN is in profit**. 

I still don't have an exit strategy but I'm pretty much conviced that I won't reach break even with Polkadot.",0,1731353764.0

On alts, once anything doubles my investment (lots are still a long way behind even!), take half - so have my money back, and the rest can ride for a while. Start taking profits when they are up again from there. If most hit an ATH, then thats a decent point to take a bit more. Play with house money and if you are late getting out it hurts a lot less.

Charles said in the video he met with someone from Trump‚Äôs transition team in Jackson Hole. Transition teams deal with the vetting and hiring of staff for a new administration. 

Also the President of IOHK recently tweeted Charles will very likely be on the commission.

Post,1gozkne,,squidguy_mc,"In the last year finance and investing got my attention and i informed myself, already also have my own investments. But i also am curious about investing in crypto, but i just dont see how you can predict to make money in crypto? So for assets like an ETF or some real estate i can understand, for example in the stock market you KNOW the stock market is probably going to rise like 10% every year as long as the US economy keeps up with the world economy, because (if i understood this correctly) a share is just the valuation of a company and every company wants to become more valuable and get more profit wich is why the stock market is going up like 10% every year. Real estate i can also understand, finding an undervalued property and renting it out, selling it because the prices get higher when its undervalued etc etc.

But i dont understand crypto. So if we look at the developement it went up and down and up and down then down for a long period and now really up again. But i dont see how it goes long-term-always-up like the stock market. How can you make long-term gains? (Im not interested in daytrading, i think its too stressfull, risky, time-consuming and barely has an impact without leverage)

So one pattern you could see here is that it always goes down and then up again. So logical would be to just wait until it goes down by much again and buy and when it goes up by like 50% sell, then wait for it to drop, repeat. Is this good? How do you make long-term profits? Cause for me idk how i should predict this. Especially with Ethereum the course seems like a giant roller coaster. Are meme coins worth to buy? They just seem like a gamble to me.",0,1731350458.0

Comment,lwmpioh,1gozkne,MaximumStudent1839,"The first biggest mistake for newbies to make is to invest based on the expecting growth in fundamentals. 

Value accrual comes from a network of old buyers holding tokens and converting new buyers to buy tokens. The price of a token is a function of its potential to grow its network of holders and old holders‚Äô conviction to keep holding the token.

This is why Bitcoin does really well. It is able to convert a legion of strong hands who don‚Äôt sell. And it is able to convert influential ppl to introduce products and push them for outsiders to buy, e.g. ETFs.

This video gives a nice tidbits about how price really appreciates in crypto: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6nqzwdGxTGc&pp=ygUKbXVyYWQgMjA0OQ%3D%3D

Ethereum‚Äôs trouble is its marketcap is so close to Bitcoin. And Ethereum‚Äôs network of holders isn‚Äôt as strong as Bitcoiners. Bitcoiners buy on the premise to just hodl and patiently wait for price appreciation. They have fewer conditionals to waiver on their conviction to hold Bitcoin.

Comment,lwmxc2x,1gozkne,anon1971wtf,"Wrong question

I suggest: what percentage of your money total do you want to allocate as a hedge vs inflating away fiat with political risks of a govt in question? 0% is very likely a wrong answer. 0.01%? 0.1%? 1%? 10%? More? Percentage should get bigger only if you properly understand benefits/risks of both parts of the total. Act like a hedge fund of your own assets

What are benefits/risks of keeping your money in fiat? What are benefits/risks of keeping your money in crypto? What are benefits/risks of keeping your money in precious metals?

> But i dont understand crypto

Then learn first and allocate capital later

> How can you make long-term gains? 

My perspective very simply put: Bitcoin supercycles driven by fixed known diminishing growth of the supply, each 4 years it is cut in half. To see it on the graph, google Bitcoin price for all its history and choose Log scale. So one may speculate long-term: convert fiat into crypto in arbitrary regular portions on the descent and inverse on the ascent, in case of success increasing piles of both. Don't try to time the market, you likely will burn like the majority who do. If you only have fiat and want to enter on an ascent, potential profit for such trades would be delayed by a full cycle",1,1731356678.0

Post,1goloe4,,eaglesfan83,"Onchain transactions are going to get up to 96% cheaper on AVAX C-Chain very soon with the implementation of ACP-125

**What is ACP-125?**

ACP-125 proposes reducing the base transaction fee from 25 nAVAX to just 1 nAVAX (96% reduction).The reason for this is most blocks are being created at the base fee level. This indicates that users are paying the base price just because that is what it is set to but not necessarily what is needed. ACP-125 is going to dynamically adjust fees so users pay what is needed to process blocks.

**ACP-125 will do all of the following;**

\- Increase efficiency

\- Make AVAX more accessible globally

\- Rapidly grow the network- Increase competitiveness with other L1s

Take a look at how much I would have saved in gas using my own wallet

  
Since 2021 I have spent 92.16 AVAX in gas.  Once ACP-125 is introduced I would have only spent 40.5 AVAX.  This would have saved me over $1900 USD at today's prices.

I don't know about you, but that is a huge savings over time that I would like to put work elsewhere in the ecosystem.

[Potential gas savings in my own wallet](https://preview.redd.it/qj3770inq70e1.png?width=3398&format=png&auto=webp&s=576c13f0457aff09444c1b7af7ba1db8f0e81968)

  
**What happens when fees are reduced?**

When BASE reduced its fees by over 95% in the first week there was a rise in daily transactions by 82%!

The potential impact that could have on the AVAX ecosystem once ACP-125 is implemented are MASSIVE!

Some of the projections based on historical fee reductions show that there could be anywhere between 39-80% increase in daily transactions, along with daily address growth of up to 200%!

That certainly would help rapidly grow the Avalanche Ecosystem coming off the heels of major partnership announcements.

https://preview.redd.it/730enk8uq70e1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ea81107468c8462d2ffbcdada4b076f87a791f2

**Why is ACP-125 so important for AVAX?**

**Become the L1 of choice:** 

We have seen many L1s launching over the years and they all need a competitive edge. 

Having the lowest fees certainly puts AVAX as a top contender.

We have already seen partnership in many sectors such as the CA DMV and so many other pictured below.

The United States is going to crack down on government spending and efficiency with Trump and Elon at the helm.

If any blockchain was positioned to take advantage of this, AVAX has to be a frontrunner with partnerships already in line and soon with even lower fees.

This is only one part of the overall improvements coming to Avalanche as part of Avalanche 9000, and with the supercycle upon us, the timing could not have been better!

[Recent AVAX Partnerships](https://preview.redd.it/v3xryfc2r70e1.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2b88e0657bd65344871dd64c1619152bee004ac)

This is just part of the overall plan in Avalanche 9000 to improve the network on multiple fronts to capitalize on the numerous partnerships and growth opportunities that have developed overt he last year.

I think there is a significant repricing coming soon to AVAX in the upcoming months and a large part of it is due to these upgrades coming before the end of the year.

This surge is attributed to Elon Musk's support and the victory of crypto-friendly candidate Donald Trump in the US presidential election. DOGE's open interest reached a new high of $2.26 billion, and its daily trading volume hit a yearly high of $13.96 billion. Musk's involvement, including his proposed 'Department of Government Efficiency,' has fueled interest in DOGE, aligning with the meme coin's ticker and boosting bullish sentiment.

This positions Ethereum as the 35th largest asset globally, highlighting its growing importance in the digital finance landscape.

Comment,lwb31hj,1gnjehh,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high of $77,000 following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower interest rates. The Federal Open Market Committee reduced the policy interest rate by a quarter percentage point, continuing from a previous 50 basis-point cut in September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the drop in inflation from 7% to 2.1% and emphasized the goal to reduce it further to 2%. The rate cut aims to support economic strength and labor market stability. Bitcoin's price surge coincided with these economic developments.

As a BTC Hodler, the way Cryptocurrencies have been moving is somewhat concerning especially with the rise of CBDCs that are awaiting to be turned on they are just waiting on the right moment. My guess is they‚Äôll start with large corporations, businesses ‚Äî from the top all the way down so that citizens are then incentivized/forced to use them.


I for one do not believe in coincidences, especially considering how well BTC has quickly adapted.

I guess my question here is: 

Do you truly believe in your deep subconscious  the way that Bitcoin operates this well and how quickly it adapts, becomes more and more secure by the minute is a coincidence? How it goes up significantly every 4 years like clockwork is a coincidence?

Knowing what we know about the US government and considering how they are the largest holders of BTC is not on purpose?

Thomas Lee of Fundstrat Capital suggests that Bitcoin's potential as a Treasury reserve asset could help offset the U.S. budget deficit. Trump's pro-crypto stance and proposed policies are expected to boost Bitcoin and altcoins. The Bitcoin Act, proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis, aims to legitimize Bitcoin as an economic asset, potentially holding up to 1 million BTC as a hedge against inflation.

Comment,lwpdrkj,lwl46k7,pop-1988,"A CBDC is not what you described in your post. It is still USD  

The FED's proposed CBDC is deliberately designed to fail before any serious attempt to implement it. The FED will own the CBDC money, but will not provide customer service. The FED will contract customer service to retail banks, and will probably pay them fees. But the documents propose that the retail banks provide the service, and mention nothing about fees. They might be hoping that the banks charge cost-recovery fees to the customer. This would destroy adoption. The FED might be planning to pay a nominal fee to the banks. No banks would sign up to that, because their services would have an open-ended cost, probably higher than the proposed fees. Also, because the FED owns the CBDC money, the bank's only role is service. There's no opportunity for the bank to earn interest

Comment,lwejo7v,1gnztse,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Web traffic to top crypto exchanges increased by 8% in October 2024, driven by the U.S. elections and the 'Uptober' trend. Binance, WhiteBit, and Coinbase led with 54 million, 33 million, and 30 million visits, respectively. Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance and Bitcoin comments contributed to increased interest. The political landscape, including Trump's election win, is expected to lead to more crypto-friendly regulations, potentially sparking a new bull run. Increased activity from retail and institutional investors also played a role in the traffic surge.

Comment,lwa5npy,1gnfpoe,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Germany missed out on $1.1 billion in profits by selling nearly 50,000 BTC at $53,000 per coin in July, as Bitcoin recently hit a new all-time high of over $77,000. The sale, conducted between June 19 and July 12, generated $2.8 billion from assets seized in the 'Movie2k' criminal case. Under German law, assets must be sold if their value fluctuates by over 10% to prevent losses. The missed profits highlight the financial impact of the early sale amid a market surge influenced by Trump's re-election and pro-crypto policies.

Comment,lwagh7x,lwaanct,RandoStonian,"At the moment, I haven't yet (very happy about that decision currently). Any interest is just added to the loan total without me having to pay it down.

As long as the collateral is worth x% more than the loan is for, it's safe from liquidation (at market value, minus a few percent in fees). If the collateral value keeps going up, I can keep coming back for more cash without repaying the old loan.

If the market dumps hard enough, I can either close the loan with cash I have, put in more collateral, or (my favorite) let them liquidate if the market dumps *that bad*, and just slowly rebuy at the new prices with money I would have spent closing the loan. 

Depending on how you've been doing things, this 'liquidation in a crash, then rebuy' strategy can be a positive ""wash sale"" tax event (currently US-legal in crypto, but not in stocks) to get on-paper losses that'll lower your tax bill.

In a way, this whole thing is like setting a stop-loss on a stash of crypto, but you get the cash up front.

You can conceivably never pay off the loans against the same collateral if BTC keeps going up and you keep your borrowing at a 'healthy' ratio that'll survive 50% market dumps without making you sweat.

Alternatively, I can pay off my loan using some of the collateral that's gone up in value since I took out my loan. Just tell them to keep some of it and give back the rest, basically.",3,1731178662.0

I guarantee most of this sub have or will do a ‚Äùround trip‚Äù (Buy and hold past the peak and into the bear marker, never to see the light of profit again) in my opinion, any previous cycle coin that hasnt approached or surpassed ATH when everything else was pumping up until march 2024, probably never will. If it‚Äôs in a long term downtrend with lower lows vs btc it probably won‚Äòt outperform BTC this cycle, or ever again. A lot of butthurt will arise in this sub from delusions about ADA MATIC ERGO VET XRP, when they underperform the market this cycle. SOL? New ATH already, likely to do well. People think the altcoin season will pump their old bags. Sure against USD, but probably not against BTC. The alt season will lump the strong alts, not old, weak, irrelevant ones. just look at a snapshot of the top 100 in 2017",12,1731182371.0

Despite past criticism, MicroStrategy's stock has surged, driven by Bitcoin's 115% rise in 2024. The company holds around 214,000 Bitcoins, valued at over $7.4 billion, with plans to increase its holdings. Saylor's strategy has faced skepticism, but Bitcoin's recent performance has bolstered MicroStrategy's position as a major corporate Bitcoin holder.

It's one of the last things you need to learn about.

TA all you like. There is a non stop cycle every 4-5 years regardless of what's going on worldwide.

Most people don't have the patience for this and either give up on the theory or just don't believe in it because it just seems way too easy.

Buy Buy buy during the bear market (2022-2025)

This pump with Bitcoin is great, but it's just the tip of the iceberg. 2025-2026 will be quite rewarding to the patient ones.

It's hard to time the exact top. I'm expecting to top out before the end of 2025, possibly flow over into 2026. But I personally think it'll peak before the end of 2025 and then start to drop like 2021.

Bitcoin is not money. It‚Äôs worth money, it has value, but just like my stamp collection and my watch collection and my kidneys, it is valuable but is NOT money.

Comment,lwcsly4,lwbqoa0,lycheedorito,"Well yeah, but we're talking about a business that is trying to grow in value that isn't necessarily always money. Take the purchase of Activision Blizzard or any other gaming company purchased by Microsoft, it cost a lot to purchase it, but it is worth it but just because of future projected sales, but the IPs they obtain are highly valued. So even if they sit on them for years, it's still an increase in value to the company. They don't have to liquidate it for it to be valuable and they aren't doing a bad job when they aren't liquidating, in fact it is often the opposite because things tend to increase in value over time. When you report your¬†net worth to your bank, etc, you are including all your assets which does, yes, include¬†your unsold house.

I can‚Äôt possibly make this more clear:

1.5% of GDP is an absurdly large amount of money for any country relative to that nation‚Äôs local finances. It would be massive in the USA. If would be massive in Vatican City. It is massive in El Salvadore.

Some payments are objectively worse when done with high degree of privacy like having possibility of a cashback. Then, privacy is not yet technologically easy for the other side of a transaction - for merchants. A merchant may prefer paying 2% to VISA, but having all received payments obscured to the public

I expect fiat to evolve beyond debit card/stablecoins, shift from govt to private and to stay. Secondary payment case of anonymous web payments is relatively small for now, will grow, but likely won't outshine the first case of paying on the spot until several minutes deliveries with drones

The main reason for Bitcoin is about what Satoshi included in the Genesis block - fighting govts who are robbing geographically unlucky savers in a roundabout way with inflation, through deficit spending and paying growing interest

Forcing gambling instead of the most careful entrepreneurial bets, forcing malinvestments through incentivizing consumption of low quality garbage cos just holding cash is even worse. Destroying little scraps of wealth that poorest productive people manage to scramble here and there

Post,1goojnb,,Sapodilla101,"I'm feeling depressed right now. I'm watching everyone make money in crypto, and here I am, broke and unable to do anything. As a blockchain/Web3 nerd, it hurts. Back in 2023, when prices were low, I was struggling to get a job as a content creator (my professional niche) until a local crypto exchange took a chance on me for a content writer role in October.

I thought back then that this was my chance to get in before the bull run starts in 2024. But unfortunately, I lost that job due to a personal incident at the end of March 2024. I had invested some of my savings from my salary payouts into crypto but had to liquidate my positions in April to repay some debts (I'm still not debt-free) and I needed cash.

Since then, I've landed a few interviews but didn't get past the final hurdle to bag an offer. Now, the bull run is in full swing with the Trump pump, but I cannot take advantage of it. I'm in talks with a couple of companies right now, and even if I get a job soon, crypto is too expensive to invest in and is only going to get more expensive as time goes by. It's safe to say that I've missed the boat.

I got a job in July and things have been going well for me for a while now. In September I decided that I'll put in $50 a month into crypto. So far I've invested $150 (lol). 

I know that this amount is basically next to nothing, but I made a promise to keep doing this until I pay off my financial responsibilities, get a better job and could afford to put more money in. At least I won't feel like I'm missing out, and it's a good way to learn to save and invest in the long run.

I remember all the money I lost and what I could have done that would have resulted in me getting rich instead, but we all know that leads to nowhere. In the words of my therapist (I was doing really bad for while) he said ""You have to forgive yourself"" only then I was able to be content with my situation and move forward.

Comment,lwkpr52,1goojnb,Junnowhoitis,"It's not really more or less expensive. There's no barrier of set amount needed to buy like a share in a stock. What matters is ROI and risk. The risk (assuming similar structure as previous cycles) gets higher the longer you wait for the cycle peak. It's pretty normal for people to get in later near the peak due to fomo and increased influence of adoption, which leads to forced holding or selling into fear. 
If your assumption is that crypto will do well long term then your goal should not be to get rich quick in a short period of time. Your goal should be growing a long term position through gradual investing over a longer period of time. 
Also it's key to remember that the vast majority of retail investors will NOT get rich off of crypto. Most have less than $1000. Most that don't hold large cap tokens lose everything. We are long past the days where small investments would lead to massive fortunes. In reality, if you are looking to truly risk it on your beliefs in crypto to get rich you are going to need a large position which you can't build in a short period of time.

History isn't a guarantee of future gains, but it can at least indicate future performance.

Post,1gnfrkb,,Calibased,"New to crypto? PLEASE READ!

The bull is returning and that means lots of newbies are being attracted. Here's some tips so that you dont make fatal mistakes and lose your money. Please feel free to contribute more!

1. Trust nothing and verifying everything. Everything is trying to scam you. Any DM, random tweet, text message, email..etc. They all need to be double and triple checked. When in doubt, dont interact. Check directly on said platform.
2. ""If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is"". You didn't win anything, nothing is free, they are not gonna ""double your money""..etc. Its all a scam. Refer back to #1.
3. Never click random links. Refer back to #1.
4. **Never EVER** share your seed phrase. Refer back to #1.
5. Add 2FA to all your accounts. I like google authenticator.
6. DEFI/self custody is NOT beginner friendly and you can easily lose your money. Permanently.  There is no customer support.
7. If you choose to do self custody/defi - Make sure you save your seed phrases somewhere safe, go slow and refer back to #1.
8. It's okay to use mainstream platforms like Robinhood and coinbase. Just make sure you have all security functions turned on.
9. When using a mainstream CEX like coinbase, always use ""advanced trading"" and set limit orders. Exchanges make a ton of money off beginners using the basic ""buy crypto"" function.
10. When performing functions, never ""assume"" anything. For example: Always verify the network and wallet address you are sending and receiving money on. If you send money to wrong wallet or using wrong network - that money is **GONE**. Everything must be in alignment.
11. Beware of high APY offerings.  ""150%APY..etc"". Its never sustainable and often serves as bait for exit liquidity. Refer to #1 and #2.
12. Profit is nothing until its realized. Selling and re-entering at the next dip is a tremendous play.",103,1731174940.0

Don't tell your friends and family. 

We crypto people are very into this game and we are sure it is the future. That often results in the urge of telling people around us about crypto and why it is so cool. If you tell them and start to ""preach"" you will have partly responsibility for their losses... not in reality, but in their mind.
Remember everyone is responsible for his own actions... People tend to forget this and will get mad at you.

If they know you are invested and BTC is all over the news they will come to you and ask for a bit to start or are jealous of ur success.

1. Always send a test transaction and check the entire address you are sending to, not just the first and last digits. 


2. Research the psychology of investing in crypto. The volatility is insane and I have experienced losing 60% - 70% of the value of my portfolio in the bear market. Downside volatility makes you want to sell and upside volatility makes you want to buy. Learning to do the opposite is a muscle you need to train. 


3. Set a long time horizon and don't invest money you would need to access within that window of time. 


4. Learn about blockchain and understand the fundamentals of the technology. Know the difference between keeping your crypto on an exchange, in a warm wallet and in a cold wallet. Weigh up the pros and cons of all options and the risks each option has.",20,1731188188.0

I entered the crypto world last May, very slowly, and I have a built a very small amount since then, with positions in BTC, SOL, NOS, and recently tiny positions in PYTH and BONK.

DCA on all positions regardless of the price, which right now is very high? Wait for the markets to settle and then take it from there?

If it goes higher, it'll go lower too. It's not a matter of if, but when. 

If you analyse trades against the market you will always second guess yourself. the best way is not to focus on micro but the macro picture of why you as an individual are investing. 

And that's why, DCA in and DCA out are great strategies. It allows you to spread the risk and sometimes lower your average buys and increase your average sell value.

What if 2 months later we see it never drop below 85k again? 

But what if in the meantime it dips down to 40k and with that 20% you sold you managed to buy back 30% of your portfolio? 

Crypto is volatile. Treat Is as such. As tempting as it might be to take advice from strangers on the internet. No one can tell you what to do with your money.

Prediction model says US inflation will rise starting January 2025, so December's Fed Funding Interest Rate could be lowered 0.5% or even 0.75%, because Fed anticipates not being able to lower the interest rate any further when inflation rate gets hot again. So if Fed lowers the interest rate by 0.5% or 0.75%, crypto will pump 100% overnight and will continue to pump hard throughout the first half of December. I wouldn't hold cryptos past December 15 if I were you.

If for some reason that Trump announces he will delay raising tariffs, that would pump cryptos again like crazy. It could start a 3month-long bull run from there. Trump could postpone the tariffs if he could negotiate with China's Xi to make US farm produces tariff-free into China.",1,1731238952.0

Comment,lw9f3rf,lw9bmfu,kallebo1337,"I understand all these sayings. However, legally it's a bit different. 

If i build a phone, to let criminals communicate via P2P and enable their illicit networks to grow, i can't say ""hey, i just provide a secure communication layer"". 

If you turn a blind on where the funds are from, you're part of it. And this really depends on every countries jurisdiction.  

CreditCard companies are liable if their layer is used for childporn for example. They could also claim ""hey, we don't know as we just provide a service"".

In the past, i took Bitcoin and i knew the funds are ""unusual"" to say the best. I wasn't 100% sure where it's from but i knew where his friends had their BTC from (asian scams). In retrospective, i shouldn't have done, but i acted as a MitM, took my 3% cut and life went on.

Overall, if you turn a blind eye onto money laundering and the source of the funds, you're enabling it and thus become part of the scheme. 

Ask me how i know. hint: i was 8 months innocent in jail for money laundering, until they realized i'm innocent and acquitted me + awarded compensatio (EU tho).",2,1731166616.0

The key difference is, that anything can be abused by criminals. This doesn't make you part of it. 

If I sell you a knife and you kill the wife - i'm clean. If you come to me and say ""i need a knife to kill my wife"", i do become part of the action as i have a responsibility now to not just not sell you a knife but also report you to authorities. i can not sell you a knife, you kill wife and i say ""i thought it's a joke"". these kind of jokes you must take very serious.

when it comes down to money laundering, any bank licensed or PSD2 licensed company has regulation and requirements they must fulfill. at the end, those services do provide a layer and they are responsible to play within governmental regulations. if not, they do get penalized. 

if i build a platform to mix bitcoin, and i know it's very popular among criminals, i continue to literally launder their money, so i can take my cut out of it, i'm nothing else than an accomplices. i can not hide behind the argument ""yeah, but how do i know criminals use it"". you have to know. you did not market your service to the people on reddit, you advertised it on the darkweb. you know what you're doing. you also knew it's illegal.

Comment,lw8hgdd,1gn8028,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Cardano (ADA) experienced a price surge of over 25% in three days, reaching above $0.43 for the first time since July. This increase is attributed to significant whale activity and heightened retail interest, as reported by Santiment. On November 7, there were 697 large transactions over $100,000, the highest since September, indicating institutional interest. Additionally, 37,892 unique ADA addresses were active, suggesting retail FOMO. The rally has renewed optimism among ADA supporters, though potential price pullbacks remain possible.

After its first ATH in Jan 2018, ADA went down 98%. People like you wrote exactly the same shit then, ignoring the many reasons why so many people like Cardano.

Well, after that -98% ADA did a nice 13,652% (that is *thirteen thousand, six hundred and fifty two* percent) to the current ATH of 3.10 USD. BTC, ETH, and ADA were the only top 10 coins by MC to make new ATH:s after the 2017/18 bull market (excluding stable/CEX).

In the bear market we just came out of, ADA dropped to -93% from ATH. We are now on our way back up. First stop is the old 2018 ATH of 1.30 USD. If we assume a similar appreciation as between 2018 ATH and 2021 ATH, ADA would reach around 7.50 USD this time around.

Comment,lwa7j3b,1gng1k2,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; A scammer attempted to hijack a Kraken crypto account by wearing a rubber mask of the victim during a video call with a support agent. The attempt failed as the mask was easily identified as fake, and the attacker couldn't provide accurate account details. Kraken's Chief Security Officer, Nick Percoco, highlighted the importance of security measures like two-factor authentication and using FIDO2 passkeys to protect against such scams. He also noted that some exchanges might not have the same security diligence as Kraken.

Comment,lwcp0na,lwcln6v,krakensupport,"Great question!

Yes, Kraken does support U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) for two-factor authentication (2FA). This includes using security keys like YubiKey, which provide a physical second layer of security in addition to your password. You can set this up in your Kraken Security settings under 2FA options.
Using U2F security keys for 2FA offers strong protection for your account, as access requires both something you know (your password) and something you have (the security key).

Initially struggling in 2020, Coplan's platform gained significant traction, especially during the 2024 presidential election, where users wagered $3.2 billion. Polymarket, which uses cryptocurrency, accurately predicted Donald Trump's victory over Kamala Harris. The platform has raised $70 million and is backed by notable figures like Nate Silver. Despite criticisms, Polymarket's prediction markets are seen as more accurate than traditional polls.

The increase in inflows coincides with Donald Trump being declared the 47th president of the United States, which traders have linked to the spike.

AMP is a proprietary walled garden which [benefits Google](https://www.socpub.com/articles/chris-graham-why-google-amp-threat-open-web-15847) and [hurts everyone else](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/19/open_source_insider_google_amp_bad_bad_bad). It is destroying the open web through anti-competitive violation of standards.

It is bad for publishers because it forces them to duplicate development effort, and prevents differentiation and customisation. It also allows Google to watch you even after you've left their search results page.

I‚Äôm very willing to explore accepting crypto payments with the objective of finding out how large of a segment in LatAm uses crypto and wants to buy our stuff.

My question: how the hell do I do this?

We need to add a payment gateway (I know Bitfinex, Binance and others solve this) But I need to be able to use th crypto we make to buy goods and services with a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù bank card or through PayPal (FYI the bank card must have a US address).

In his video found on YouTube, he said in 2025 he will approach the industry differently that he has so far.

Comment,lwd5uuy,1gnjjlb,DalekCoffee,"If you are American I would recommend against crypto debit cards tbh.  
Unless someonehas a silver bullet for this, every time you use crypto and it is converted by the card it is still considered a ""sale"" transaction or a liquidation and you need to report that trade as well as it's profit or loss

His administration‚Äôs focus on deregulation and business-friendly policies will create a more favorable environment for blockchain and cryptocurrency growth, which I see EOS benefiting from directly. The tech in the white paper is still innovative and absolutely has proven to be faster than the competition. The price is up 27% today and has moved from #60 to 52 in 24 hours.

For those unfamiliar or have forgotten, EOS is designed for high-speed transactions and low fees, which sets it apart as a reliable platform for developers building DApps. At one point, it was a top-5 market cap coin and if we see more tech growth and a lighter regulatory touch, EOS‚Äôs infrastructure will make the price explode.

Post,1go0n55,,sonmanutd,"Trump has won the 2024 Election with a clear margin. At the time of writing, Trump leads 3% in popular vote and 301-226 in Electoral College. This result was to the dismay of pollsters and pundits, who predicted a tight race. They once again got Trump's votes wrong by a whopping 3 percentage, just like they did in 2016, 2020, prompting questions about whether the Shy Trump vote. The ones who got the election rights were not the pollsters and pundits, but the betting markets like Polymarket, Kalshi, etc, where millions of people around the world pouring $3 billion dollar worth of liquidity to bet on who will win the election. The betting odds have Donald Trump consistently at 65% weeks before the election and 58% the day before the election, despite a slew of good polls for Kamala Harris.

[Polymarket was way ahead of the polls leading up to the election](https://preview.redd.it/7a3ryqscs20e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5b4e648d892188a9e2d6ded63640952574cb9a9)

This was not the first time betting markets show signs of being ahead of the mainstream media and pundits. Back in May, mainstream media outlets declared that Biden age was not an issue. Paul Krugman declared that Biden ""is in full possession of his faculties ‚Äî completely lucid and with excellent grasp of detail."" while Morning Joe saying that ""this Biden is the best Biden he has ever seen"". Yet Polymarket audiences do not fully trust this news, pricing in a 10% odds of Biden being replaced, which has proven to be correct. The site also gained popularity for early resolving the soundness of Room-Temperature Superconductor, predicting Trump introducing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

What's interesting is that unlike traditional sports betting where the odds are decided by the house, this election betting odds was fully decided by the people's bets. The site touts that their betting odd aggregation represents the ""Wisdom of the crowd"". Was their success a mere luck? Or is there something fundamental about betting markets that help the everyday crypto bros thirsty for money beat the experts at their game?

# Betting Market as a Truth Seeking mechanism

Betting market is a marketplace where participants buy shares on a claim of $1 if a certain condition (such as Trump / Kamala wins the election) turns out to be true. Obviously, it is not certain either would win the election, so one would only buy the shares for the price less than they believe is the actual odds of their side winning. No one would buy Trump for 90 cents if they only believe his chance of winning is 50%, but might buy Kamala for 30 cents if they believe Kamala can win 70 cents, since the difference represents the discount of the bets. However, the act of buying a share will also push the price of that share up as demand increases, while selling pushes their share down as demand decreases. The pricing of shares works in such a way that the two opposite sides simply provide the rewards for the others, while the house takes a small transaction fee. Letting the orderbook play out, we have a marginal price that should represent the aggregated opinion of all market participants, weighted by the bet volume of the market participants.

This mechanism creates three important dynamics:

\+ It creates an incentive for insiders to introduce knowledge to the market. For example, if someone in the Kamala campaign knows that she has a major gaffe, they could buy Trump low, pushing the price of Trump (and the market opinion of Trump winning) up. They effectively get paid to introduce knowledge. This makes the betting market both a great aggregator of news and a funding source for truth seeking journalism.

\+ The bigger the liquidity, the more interested society is in having an answer to a question. This opens up a major funding source for big social science research questions in the form of betting opportunities. Rather than seeking funding from the government, a business can literally try to just place the correct bet by investing into a team of researchers and hope that they can bring profit by answering the question correctly. Funding sources can reach billions of dollars in liquidity.

\+ Protects against news manipulation by effectively flowing the money of dishonest actors to honest actors. Suppose that one camp wants to manipulate the news, they can massively causes one side to go up. While their behaviors can make it seem like the market is changing their thoughts, they effectively create opportunities for truth seekers by further discounting the price of the truth, creating an opportunity for bigger profits.

In this manner, the free market becomes a real time weighting of different news sources that incentivize honest reporting and is resistant to manipulation and censorship. As an example, a netizen from France named ""Theo4"" places a $30 million bet on Trump winning the popular vote (an even tougher bet than Trump winning the electoral college) at 26 cents. At the time, most polls had Trump and Harris either in dead heat or Harris up by 1 or 2 points. Yet this individual figured out that the people who are polled might answer more honestly if he asked ""Who do you think your neighbor will vote for?"" instead of ""Who would you vote for?"". He effectively sampled people's neighbors instead of people themselves, which doesn't make a difference in sampling population but makes a difference in truthfulness. The person realized that Trump is massively ahead of Harris, placed a big bet and won a handsome profit. We can see that in this example, the market liquidity becomes both an indication of interest and a funding source, rewarding the people who can solve problems and have skins in the game. We also see that it wasn't the experts or the pollsters or the social science researcher who solved the Shy Trump Vote problems, but a random netizen who wants to make money. The market was able to sample his genius purely by its own incentive mechanism.

# Crypto is the vehicle of trust in the 21st century

The rise of crypto and betting markets have to be put in context of the overall history of the Internet. The Internet has completely democratized the news space. Everyone can have their own newsletter and TV channel. This has resulted in two major trends. 

(1) It creates significant opportunities for individuals to spread their ideas and influence. Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who broke the NSA story with Edward Snowden, starts not with a journalism degree but a blog post. Julian Assange, author of Wikileaks, was a computer programmer. 

(2) There is an incredible rise in the amount of consumable content, spams and clickbait to capture human's attention. Spam is a problem as old as the internet. It is a problem because it is a productive industry where the cost of content creation is near 0, while the reward for successfully capturing attention is enormous.

The democratization of news has weakened the influence of traditional media outlets like New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, etc. Instead of using their massive funding to create stories of equal quality as the aforementioned journalists, they have joined in the attention seeking games. News have become clickbait and partisan, designed to validate the reader's bias and keep their subscriptions rolling. The huge economic incentives for biased news increasingly drive the traditional press away from their original truth seeking mission. As a matter of fact, New York Times gain their majority of revenue from cooking and gaming subscription, while their journalism basically operates at a loss.

We are now living in the era of Artificial Intelligence, where content creation is getting increasingly cheaper, almost to the point of spams. To maximize attention, all contents are generated, personalized and tailored to individual preference, creating a universal truth deficit. As we got further and further into our own bubbles, and as content creation costs go down to zero, there is a need to reintroduce rewards for truth seeking, as well as ""skin in the game"", where someone not only makes a statement, but ""puts the money where their mouth is"".

This is where crypto comes into play. As early as 2002, Adam Back invented Hashcash, the precursor to Bitcoin proof-of-work. He was not necessarily trying to solve the problem of money, but the problem of spams by introducing a small friction, requiring people to do some work before publishing. It was thought that people would not act dishonestly if the act itself already has some economic cost upfront. Others would also trust the act more, given that the actor has performed a guaranteed economic loss. It is both a trust introducing and trust transmitting vehicles. 22 years after the Proof-of-work papers, we have Bitcoin, a token system that is decentralized, voluntary, and censorship resistant with a total market cap of $1.5 trillion. It grows alongside a vibrant ecosystem of token blockchain with staking, mining and betting services that are completely borderless and uncontrolled by the classical manager of money. It develops a $120 billion market cap for dollar stablecoins, which the populace of North Africa has an easier time trusting than the currencies controlled by their federal reserve. And now, we see crypto betting markets gaining $160 billion worth of liquidity and a level. These decentralized institutions could not have been popular without the fact that trust in governmental institutions has declined for the past 50 years.

# A new model of journalism

[The new model of journalism will be based on market, not reputation](https://preview.redd.it/1dvkk0xjs20e1.png?width=2088&format=png&auto=webp&s=926eb9a52117a1f5964db923e955bbb36b9fedb3)

The combination of news and betting markets give birth to new truth models. No longer do we have an audience following ""experts"" with PhD degrees providing their opinions on pre-determined ""authoritative"" news channels like NYT or MSNBC. In the new world, everyone can be a journalist. With a professional grade camera, microphone and typewriter in the pocket, anyone can talk to people on the ground, or publish their own research and opinions. Platform providers put the NYT, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News alongside the new alternative media in an open public square of information. No one can know for sure what are truths and lies among the overload of news, so it would be the job of the betting markets to sort it out, and give an aggregated price that represents the average wisdom of the crowd on what quality news should be focused on, and what redundant news should be discarded.

This does not mean the death of news. Far from it. The free market still needs input to decide what is the best aggregation. We have seen that the market is not always correct and can overreact to bad inputs. 2 days before the election, a poll by Ann Seltzer has Kamala Harris up in Iowa by 3 percentage points. Trump ended up winning the state by 16 points, proving the poll way off, but at that time, the news of the poll significantly increased the odds of Kamala Harris winning from 35% to 50% before dipping back down to 42% the day before the election. This is the first case study of how betting markets remain sensitive to fake news, but that the monetary incentive to truth seekers is such that mistakes are corrected relatively quickly.

[French Authority already thinks of cracking down betting markets](https://preview.redd.it/m76yscuns20e1.png?width=1064&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd42400377bc9fc1c87c0f7bbe72a5a15733c657)

It remains to be seen whether the free market can be better at being more resilient to wrong news or market manipulation over time. One thing remains certain: If the odds deviate from the truth, it creates arbitrage incentives for truth seekers. Much like Proof of Work requires skin in the game, governments and propagandists cannot manipulate the bets without incurring enormous economic costs which actually become rewards for honest truth seekers. Combined with a censorship-resistant payment network, it represents a significant threat to power establishments who want to control the flow of information and the truth. We have already seen the first sign of the establishment taking this threat seriously by the French authorities planning to ban Polymarket, an ironic act given the fact that one of their countrymen just successfully took 50 million dollars from the business.

# ""If Crypto is libertarian, then AI is communist"" - Peter Thiel

In the 1970s, there were two competing visions of the Internet. The vision that we came to know about the internet was one by the United States, where individuals connect with each other peer-to-peer. Information passes around voluntarily in a decentralized, free market manner. Lesser known was the vision by the Soviet Union, where the internet merely introduced a connection between each individual and Gosplan (the Soviet central planning committee). Each individual merely provides production input and information, while the Gosplan uses sophisticated methodology and calculation to calculate the exact supply and demand required, and allocate resource and production accordingly. With the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States vision won a resounding victory in the 20th century, birthing the open-source software institution protected by the 1st amendment, which I personally regarded as among the US greatest achievements.

Yet the 21st century saw the comeback of the Soviet vision. Big Techs have increasingly centralized the internet by offering free products in exchange for your data and infinitely satisfying short-term dopamine surge. Surveillance capitalism has become rampant, where every ad and product recommendation is tailored by every movement and action packaged in the data we have sold. These are the capabilities that the Soviet secret police of the old could only dream of. Artificial Intelligence, for all its beauty and convenience, is a technology that inherently rewards the already existing data monopoly. The already dominant positions that these tech companies have will only worsen the surveillance situation, strengthening the matrices that we are part of.

If you are a fan of a decentralized, free and open internet, the vision that the United States used to champion, then Crypto is your best bet. It is a decentralized, peer-to-peer information transmitting system designed not to be under government control. It reflects the truth not by being the arbiter of truth, but by creating reward incentives for truthful actors. It weighs the abundance of data that we produce by the money that individuals are willing to stake for that information.

The rise of chatbots and betting markets in 2024 have cemented the role of AI and crypto in the information world. Our future will be shaped by these two beautiful, yet ideologically opposite technologies. Those who master these two technologies hold the key to winning the 21st century. Which technologies do these masters prefer, and the fate of the world with it, remain to be seen.",0,1731245222.0

Comment,lw41hl8,lw25c6a,TheDiscoJellyfish,"Because memecoins spererate themselves from shitcoins by not even claiming to be good tech in the first place, while shitcoins actually claim to be good tech, but heavily lack in the most basic and main goals of cryptocurrencies, which is primarily security being garuanteed through decentralization.

Altcoins (that are not shitcoins) are coins that aim to be and are at least equally or more secure than Bitcoin and at least as or more decentralized than Bitcoin, while improving aspects Bitcoin lacks or slightly lacks in such as scalability, decentralization, security, fungibility, anonymity, solo mining profitability/pool decentralization, speed, etc.

By now everyone should know that most memecoins are not just a joke such as Dogecoin, Pepe and Shiba Inu, which are the established ones, which are already incredibly volatile to trade with, but basically all of the newer ones are scam presale coins that quickly drain other peoples investments values within hours after release with their price never recovering. Buying Memecoins that are not Doge, Pepe or Shiba Inu, is literally just donating money to somebody else. Since they dont tell you that its actually just donation, its just straight up robbery or fraud. No more and no less.

Other coins - even the ones with premine and presale still sometimes try to be good coins, such as Ethereum, although they still arent. Thats why Ethereum is not a Memecoin, but more of a shitcoin. Not super shit - your ETH isnt going to disappear over night, but ETH will not stay around forever. Like other coins that are not shit like Bitcoin, which has very low risk but with some risk of centralization or monero, which has 0 risk of centralization not only because of ASIC resistance but also due to tail emission, which equalizes inflation and deflation to end up at 0. But lets not get started about tokenomics here.",1,1731087286.0

""You say that now, but if bitcoin really takes off I can see lots of get-rich-quick imitators coming on the scene: gitcoin, nitcoin, witcoin, titcoin, shitcoin.. Some of them are sure to attract users with promises like ""Why use bitcoin, where you can only generate 50 bitcoins every few months? Use shitcoin instead, and you'l get 51 shitcoins every 2 minutes"".

In hindsight I should have kept all the BTC I had in 2018 instead of selling them.

Coinbase's chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, is urging the SEC to reform its approach to crypto regulation, hoping for a framework that encourages innovation. The election has also led to positive inflows into Ether ETFs, potentially driving its price higher. An SEC shakeup could further impact the crypto industry's future in the US.

Comment,lw3umax,lw2kp76,Shoemugscale,"I've been telling normies about it, but they just don‚Äôt get it. If the U.S. starts adding BTC to its strategic reserves, buying 200k BTC per year, it would be a huge game-changer. This kind of sustained demand from a major economy would shrink the available supply, pushing up prices fast. A lot of analysts are already projecting big numbers‚ÄîCathie Wood sees $1 million per BTC by 2030, and Michael Saylor is talking $14 million in 15 years.

This move would make BTC more like a reserve asset, similar to gold, but with a limited, fixed supply. And if other countries start following suit, we‚Äôre talking a potential race to accumulate, where nations and big institutions scramble for their piece of the BTC pie. If this happens, we could easily see BTC in the $300k‚Äì$1M range within the next 5 to 10 years as demand skyrockets and supply tightens. Long term? If Bitcoin truly becomes a global reserve asset, those $1M‚Äì$10M+ predictions might not be so crazy after all",3,1731085287.0

This stems from investments and sponsorships made by former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried before FTX's collapse. The lawsuit highlights a $12 million sponsorship of Scaramucci's SALT conference and a $10 million investment in the SkyBridge Coin Fund. FTX also acquired a 30% stake in SkyBridge's investment vehicles for $45 million. The estate claims these investments lacked financial sense and accuses SkyBridge of violating agreement terms.

Polymarket recently encouraged users to close US presidential prediction bets and reinvest winnings, offering incentives. The platform plans to raise an additional $50 million, with major investors like Peter Thiel‚Äôs Founders Fund involved.

Comment,lw3wemk,1gmnghq,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has achieved the third-highest year-to-date inflows among US ETFs in 2024, with $26.174 billion, and a 48.52% return. On November 7, IBIT saw a $1.1 billion inflow in a single day, surpassing the annual flows of most US ETFs. This highlights strong investor interest in Bitcoin-based products and suggests a shift in investor sentiment towards digital assets. IBIT's success may lead to more Bitcoin-focused products, integrating digital assets into traditional financial markets.

Post,1gnwr3l,,Sad-Struggle7797,"I have had my reservations about the Ton Blockchain, particularly after the Notcoin, DOGs, and CATI airdrops. Subsequent projects have not been encouraging. Apart from the aforementioned others seem more focused on farming users rather than enabling users to farm tokens.  
  
It's assumptive objective of onboarding users could be taking a new turn considering the increase of mini apps trading on Telegram. Tho sniper bot may have been the first to initiate trading activities on Telegram. Recently, we have seen exchanges exploring the chain but with limited features atm;    
Bitget; available for spot and perp futures  
Gate; only spot  
BingX; only copy trading.  
  
Having traditional trading platforms accessible through Telegram mini apps will not only make these platforms more accessible and save space for downloading apps but provide opportunities for newbies and airdrop hunters to receive airdrops.   
  
While the Ton Blockchain is growing, it is important to examine its safety against bad actors. If trading platforms are going to explore the chain, the presence of rampant scams should be addressed and receive proper regulation. This will encourage the onboarding of more trading platforms that could provide a wide range of options for potential users.",0,1731229928.0

Post,1gnv488,,Deafolt,"With the recent upswing in the crypto market I had been looking into a few coins to try and ascertain their long term value. I came across Ellipsis (EXP) a few weeks ago after its increase from its all time low and am trying to get a better read on why the coin is valued as it currently is.

A decentralised exchange token on the Binamce Smartchain that advertised itself as 'secire', 'low slippage' and 'stable'. While the proce dropped steadily after it forked in March 2022 (as did almost all coins) it seems to be on a track to recovery. After a 300+% increase from its ATL Ellipsis has shifted into what I see as pendulum state, moving within a relatively tight high/low range. 

My real question is why is the market cap so low? Currently sitting below 3.5 million USD while some DEX coins have more than 5 billion. New to the space so any insight would be greatly appreciated",0,1731222733.0

Comment,lwdqdbg,lwdpckd,miah66,"Well, it's mostly  because on BSC, and several other popular chains, there are really no barriers to entry and anyone can create a coin. Coingecko lists over 15k different coins at this point and it's possible many of them will have giant spikes in volatility, it's just that with low market caps, it doesnt take much to inflate or deflate the price dramatically. Most of these are probably dead projects and/or scam coins. I stick to the  top 100 market cap coins, but i'm hardly a degen.",3,1731224628.0

im in a pretty complex situation atm.. i bought a coin named 0x0 ai on the exchange MEXC.
On mexc the coin is trading for 15,5 cent. On uniswap its trading for 17,5 cent. 

THAT is a 17% higher price, then the one I was subjected to.

Does that mean i can send it from mexc to uniswap and essentially earn almost 17% just by transferring my coins from mexc to uniswap? 


Or is that not possible since u can only send eth to uniswap?

If that is the case what can I do, cuz this is just straight scamming from Mexc...

So I completely forgot i had an airdrop of $CLOUD tokens from sanctum. I just claimed them.

I got the claim through my Brave Wallet, but it did not show up in my Brave Wallet.

There didn't seem to be any $CLOUD visible in my wallet, and i can not figure out how to add it to my wallet.

I tried to search it in the ""Available assets"" tab in the ""add an asset"" part, but it did not show up.

Then I tried to add it by using the custom asset tab, but i could not figure out the Decimals of Precision, or the token name but i assumed that was just cloud.

I have been googling all morning and i can not find any info on this.

Comment,lw72wtu,lw70dh0,intelw1zard,"Ideally, my goal is to fully exit once my stack grows to 350k.

I will cash out and dump it into a real estate property to then rent out or use it to buy 40-50 acres of recreational land. 

If land, I will build a small cabin on it and rent it out to someone when I'm not using it as well as lease it as a hunting spot.

I will then use the income stream from the above to rebuild my crypto stack and repeat this cycle again after 5-6 years of rebuilding.  Will likely go the real estate route as the land route isnt as profitable as I'm not going to harvest the timber or any resources of the land itself.",2,1731123259.0
Comment,lw75rjc,lw72wtu,Fiddlediddle888,"Let me plus that up for you. Get the land, build your first cabin as cheap as you can and live out of that one, set up some small scale farming that you can handle, try to set up a semi off grid system with self sustainable food and energy production projects. Get a cheap used trailer RV, they practically give them away sometimes. Advertise it and hire a young hippie couple live in for free in exchange for tending the land and helping you on the property, maybe also give them a cost of living stipend. Keep building rental cabins. They will get rented, it will take some time, but in maybe 6 to 10 years it will be printing money for you. Maybe the couple decide they want to stay if you let them build there own cabin, or something like that. Maybe they have kids, and you eventually sell a piece of the land to them. It all come full circle.",5,1731124465.0
Comment,lw788nw,lw75rjc,intelw1zard,"Some really interesting ideas.

This land would be located within an hour drive of me or so. I dont want to live there as I already have a primary residence and my wife would certainly be like ""nah"" if I attempted to convince her to move into some small ass cabin in the woods lol.

Farming sounds like a lot of work and I'm far too lazy for such things nor do I want some hippies living on my land and pickin' all my delicious berries.

I will certainly put in a lot of work to get the land ready and setup for hunting season. It's a lot prep work and upkeep. Deer season is the big one around here as well at dove season. I can sell hunting leases for $2,000/year per person. I'd cap my hunting camp lease at 5 people a year as 50 acres aint that large. $10k/year just from the hunting lease and I could list my cabin on places like HipCamp and likely bring in another $3-4k/year from that or just find someone to live there during off season. 

I think the best move would be attempt to buy the surrounding land after a few years to keep growing my hunting plot bigger and bigger and I could host more hunters. Could get it doing $80k-100k/year if I dump like $1-$1.5M into land.

Regardless, the land idea is more of a project I'll do once I get bored and just wanna chill all day long. I think I will stick with the real estate and bank of rental income and property appreciation.",2,1731125550.0

Comment,lw6i4ag,1gmwzf3,Capital-Physics4042,"ADA is going from strength to stregth. Smart money, whales, and analysts alike are now forecasting the road to $8 to $15 in the short to medium term. On a related note ERGO is up 60% riding the rising tide of ADA. A 10x from here to $15 is not far-fetched, and is in fact very likely in the short to medium term. ERGO is a solid low-cap coin.

Comment,lw86c22,1gn6ei4,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Flare and Red Date Technology are conducting trials in Hong Kong to enable mainland Chinese residents to purchase stablecoins issued by IDA. This initiative allows for anonymous registration while complying with Chinese real-name laws, using the China Real-Name Decentralized Identifier System (RealDID). The trials align with Hong Kong's new stablecoin regulations, although major stablecoins like Tether and Circle's U.S. dollar stablecoins are not included.
