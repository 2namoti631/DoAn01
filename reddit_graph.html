The rule for 2025 is basically that if your insurance plan offered by your employer costs less than 9.02% of your gross income, you can\u0027t get premium assistance for plans on the exchange. Health insurance plans from employers always actually cost a lot more than what the employee has deducted directly from their wages. The majority of premiums are paid by your employer. This means that the actual premium cost of comparable exchange plans will be astronomical relative to your pay if you don\u0027t get premium assistance, because the premium credits basically fulfill the same role as the employer portion of your insurance plan (and, IIRC, are supposed to be funded by the employers who pay penalties for not offering \"affordable\" plans that meet the 9.02% threshold, meaning almost all employers offer an \"affordable\" option since they have to pay penalties anyway if they don\u0027t). So the unfortunate answer is that your options indeed may be to eat the cost or look for a new job.
